Sierra Nevada soil carbon time series project

This repository contains data as well as data processing and analysis scripts for a project looking at parent material and climate effects on soil carbon dynamics. 

Soil samples were collected over two decades (in 2001, 2009, and 2019) at the same nine sites in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of CA, USA. The ecosystems found on the western slope of the Sierra Nevadas follow a characteristic vegetation sequence with elevation that correlates with an increase in mean annual precipitation and a decrease in mean annual temperature. We collected samples in the mid-elevation Ponderosa pine (*P. ponderosa*) dominant forest, the slightly higher elevation and correspondingly cooler white fir (*A. concolor*) dominant forest, and the subalpine red fir (*A. magnifica*) dominant forest at the highest elevation. 

The Sierras are also characterized by different lithologies running from north to south, enabling us to collect samples from the same ecosystem types but from soils developed on different parent materials: basalt, andesite, and granodiorite.

Soils from 2001 and 2009 were collected and analyzed by C. Rasmussen and colleagues; soils from the 2019 sampling campaign were collected and analyzed by J. Beem-Miller and colleagues.

Data from a combination of isotopic techniques and soil fractionation schemes will be combined with process modeling to assess how parent material and climate interact to control soil carbon dynamics on time scales ranging from annual to millenial.
