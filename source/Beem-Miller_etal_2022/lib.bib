  abstract = {Many studies in ecology, soil science, and global climate change require accurate estimates of soil organic C (SOC). When calibrated with direct SOC determinations, loss-on-ignition (LOI) has been proposed as a rapid, inexpensive, and accurate method for estimating SOC. We collected 0- to 15- and 15- to 50-cm mineral soil samples from 102 plots within a 110 000-ha ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. \& C. Lawson) landscape to develop regression equations between LOI and SOC measured with an elemental C analyzer. We tested nine LOI temperature duration combinations ranging from 300 to 600C and 2 to 6 h to discern optimal combinations for estimating SOC, used the optimal combination to develop regressions for 100 samples each of 0- to 15- and 15- to 50-cm depths, and assessed whether stratifying samples into ecosystem types improved LOISOC equations. Pearson r2 values between LOI and SOC did not exceed 0.74 for any LOI temperatureduration combination. These values showed no consistent trend to change with increasing duration, but tended to be slightly higher at the lowest temperature (300C). Multiple regressions, including LOI and clay concentration, explained only 78 (015 cm) and 64\% (1550 cm) of the variation in SOC. Relationships between LOI and SOC found in this study are among the weakest reported in the soil literature, and it remains unclear precisely why observed relationships were weak. Our results suggest that LOI may be useful for roughly estimating SOC in this region, but other methods or modifi cations to LOI are needed when more accurate SOC measurements are required.},

  abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) can be defined by measurable chemical and physical pools, such as mineral-associated carbon, carbon physically entrapped in aggregates, dissolved carbon, and fragments of plant detritus. Yet, most soil models use conceptual rather than measurable SOC pools. What would the traditional pool-based soil model look like if it were built today, reflecting the latest understanding of biological, chemical, and physical transformations in soils? We propose a conceptual model—the Millennial model—that defines pools as measurable entities. First, we discuss relevant pool definitions conceptually and in terms of the measurements that can be used to quantify pool size, formation, and destabilization. Then, we develop a numerical model following the Millennial model conceptual framework to evaluate against the Century model, a widely-used standard for estimating SOC stocks across space and through time. The Millennial model predicts qualitatively similar changes in total SOC in response to single factor perturbations when compared to Century, but different responses to multiple factor perturbations. We review important conceptual and behavioral differences between the Millennial and Century modeling approaches, and the field and lab measurements needed to constrain parameter values. We propose the Millennial model as a simple but comprehensive framework to model SOC pools and guide measurements for further model development.},

  abstract = {Developing and testing decadal-scale predictions of soil response to climate change is difficult because there are few long-term warming experiments or other direct observations of temperature response. As a result, spatial variation in temperature is often used to characterize the influence of temperature on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks under current and warmer temperatures. This approach assumes that the decadal-scale response of SOC to warming is similar to the relationship between temperature and SOC stocks across sites that are at quasi steady state; however, this assumption is poorly tested. We developed four variants of a Reaction-network-based model of soil organic matter and microbes using measured SOC stocks from a 4,000-km latitudinal transect. Each variant reflects different assumptions about the temperature sensitivities of microbial activity and mineral sorption. All four model variants predicted the same response of SOC to temperature at steady state, but different projections of transient warming responses. The relative importance of Qmax, mean annual temperature, and net primary production, assessed using a machine-learning algorithm, changed depending on warming duration. When mineral sorption was temperature sensitive, the predicted average change in SOC after 100 years of 5 °C warming was −18\% if warming decreased sorption or +9\% if warming increased sorption. When microbial activity was temperature sensitive but mineral sorption was not, average site-level SOC loss was 5\%. We conclude that spatial climate gradients of SOC stocks are insufficient to constrain the transient response; measurements that distinguish process controls and/or observations from long-term warming experiments, especially mineral fractions, are needed.},

One pool of carbon considered particularly stable across climate zones and soil types is formed when dissolved organic carbon sorbs to minerals. We quantified, for the first time, the potential of mineral soils to sorb additional dissolved organic carbon (DOC) for six soil orders. We compiled 402 laboratory sorption experiments to estimate the additional DOC sorption potential, that is the potential of excess DOC sorption in addition to the existing background level already sorbed in each soil sample. We estimated this potential using gridded climate and soil geochemical variables within a machine learning model. We find that mid- and low-latitude soils and subsoils have a greater capacity to store DOC by sorption compared to high-latitude soils and topsoils. The global additional DOC sorption potential for six soil orders is estimated to be 107 ± 13 Pg C to 1 m depth. If this potential was realized, it would represent a 7\% increase in the existing total carbon stock.},

  abstract = {Intensive tillage during the last century has greatly reduced organic carbon contents of Oklahoma cropland. Increased public interest in carbon sequestration and the potential for carbon storage in no-till soils to offset CO2 emissions has brought about the need for accurate estimates of carbon sequestration in Oklahoma. Eight locations across Oklahoma were soil sampled to determine the impact of no-till farming practices on soil carbon storage. Locations consisted of side by side no-till and tilled fields sampled at four sites in each field. Samples were divided into 0-10, 10-20, 20-40, 40-70, and 70-110cm depths and analyzed for organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN). Averaged across locations and depth, the concentration of organic carbon (OC) was 0.7gkg-1 greater in no-till compared to tilled fields. As expected, differences between no-till and conventional till were dependent on length of time in no-till and annual precipitation. The greater the time in no-till management and the higher the annual precipitation, the greater the carbon stocks compared to conventional till fields. Despite the high degree of variation among sample locations, the mass of OC was significantly (p=0.07), greater in the NT compared to that found in the CT fields, with the average difference being 8.6Mgha-1. The highest OC accumulation was observed in Miami with an average of 3.5Mgha-1year-1, while at Lahoma 2 and Goodwell no accumulation of OC was observed. Eliminating tillage operations can increase OC accumulation with the presence of adequate rainfall and an extended period of time. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

We highlight important plant adjustments to climate change, elevated atmospheric CO2, and/or nutrient limitations that are currently not—or only partially—incorporated in ecosystem models by reviewing experimental studies and compiling data. Plant adjustments concern C:N:P stoichiometry, photosynthetic capacity, nutrient resorption rates, allocation patterns, symbiotic N2 fixation and root exudation (phosphatases, carboxylates) and the effect of root exudation on nutrient mobilization in the soil rhizosphere (P solubilization, biochemical mineralization of organic P and priming effect). We showed that several plant adjustments could be formulated and calibrated using existing experimental data in the literature. Finally, we proposed a roadmap for future research because improving ecosystem models necessitate specific data and collaborations between modelers and empiricists.},

  abstract = {Estimation of carbon contents and stocks are important for carbon sequestration, greenhouse gas emissions and national carbon balance inventories. For Denmark, we modeled the vertical distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) and bulk density, and mapped its spatial distribution at five standard soil depth intervals (0-5, 5-15, 15-30, 30-60 and 60-100 cm) using 18 environmental variables as predictors. SOC distribution was influenced by precipitation, land use, soil type, wetland, elevation, wetness index, and multi-resolution index of valley bottom flatness. The highest average SOC content of 20 g kg-1 was reported for 0-5 cm soil, whereas there was on average 2.2 g SOC kg-1 at 60-100 cm depth. For SOC and bulk density prediction precision decreased with soil depth, and a standard error of 2.8 g kg-1 was found at 60-100 cm soil depth. Average SOC stock for 0-30 cm was 72 t ha-1 and in the top 1 m there was 120 t SOC ha-1. In total, the soils stored approximately 570 Tg C within the top 1 m. The soils under agriculture had the highest amount of carbon (444 Tg) followed by forest and semi-natural vegetation that contributed 11\% of the total SOC stock. More than 60\% of the total SOC stock was present in Podzols and Luvisols. Compared to previous estimates, our approach is more reliable as we adopted a robust quantification technique and mapped the spatial distribution of SOC stock and prediction uncertainty. The estimation was validated using common statistical indices and the data and high-resolution maps could be used for future soil carbon assessment and inventories.},

  abstract = {Soils of temperate forests store significant amounts of organic matter and are considered to be net sinks of atmospheric CO2. Soil organic carbon (SOC) turnover has been studied using the ?14C values of bulk SOC or different SOC fractions as observational constraints in SOC models. Further, the ?14C values of CO2 that evolved during the in- cubation of soil and roots have been widely used together with ?14C of total soil respiration to partition soil respira- tion into heterotrophic respiration (HR) and rhizosphere res- piration. However, these data have not been used as joint observational constraints to determine SOC turnover times. Thus, we focus on (1) how different combinations of ob- servational constraints help to narrow estimates of turnover times and other parameters of a simple two-pool model, the Introductory Carbon Balance Model (ICBM); (2) whether re- laxing the steady-state assumption in a multiple constraints approach allows the source/sink strength of the soil to be de- termined while estimating turnover times at the same time. To this end ICBM was adapted to model SOC and SO14C in parallel with litterfall and the ?14C of litterfall as driv- ing variables. The ?14C of the atmosphere with its promi- nent bomb peak was used as a proxy for the ?14C of lit- terfall. Data from three spruce-dominated temperate forests in Germany and the USA (Coulissenhieb II, Solling D0 and Howland Tower site) were used to estimate the parameters of ICBM via Bayesian calibration. Key findings are as fol- lows: (1) the joint use of all four observational constraints (SOC stock and its ?14C, HR flux and its ?14C) helped to considerably narrow turnover times of the young pool (pri- marily by ?14C of HR) and the old pool (primarily by ?14C of SOC). Furthermore, the joint use of all observational con- straints made it possible to constrain the humification factor in ICBM, which describes the fraction of the annual outflux from the young pool that enters the old pool. The Bayesian parameter estimation yielded the following turnover times (mean±standard deviation) for SOC in the young pool: Coulissenhieb II 1.1±0.5 years, Solling D0 5.7±0.8 years and Howland Tower 0.8±0.4 years. Turnover times for the old pool were 377±61 years (Coulissenhieb II), 313±66 years (Solling D0) and 184±42 years (Howland Tower), re- spectively. (2) At all three sites the multiple constraints ap- proach was not able to determine if the soil has been los- ing or storing carbon. Nevertheless, the relaxed steady-state assumption hardly introduced any additional uncertainty for the other parameter estimates. Overall the results suggest that using ?14C data from more than one carbon pool or flux helps to better constrain SOC models.},

  abstract = {Profiles of soil organic carbon (SOC) are often characterized by a steep increase of \textsuperscript{14}C age with depth, often leading to subsoil \textsuperscript{14}C ages of more than 1000 years. These observations have generally been reproduced in SOC models by introducing a SOC pool that decomposes on the time-scale of millennia. The overemphasis of chemical recalcitrance as the major factor for the persistence of SOC was able to provide a mechanistic justification for these very low decomposition rates. The emerging view on SOC persistence, however, stresses that apart from molecular structure a multitude of mechanisms can lead to the long-term persistence of organic carbon in soils. These mechanisms, however, have not been incorporated into most models. Consequently, we developed the SOC profile model COMISSION which simulates vertically resolved SOC concentrations based on representations of microbial interactions, sorption to minerals, and vertical transport. We calibrated COMISSION using published concentrations of SOC, microbial biomass and mineral-associated OC (MOC), and in addition, \textsuperscript{14}C contents of SOC and MOC of a Haplic Podzol profile in North-Eastern Bavaria, Germany. In order to elucidate the contribution of the implemented processes to the \textsuperscript{14}C age in different parts of the profile, we performed model-experiments in which we switched off the limitation of SOC decomposition by microbes, sorptive stabilization on soil minerals, and dissolved OC (DOC) transport. By splitting all model pools into directly litter-derived carbon and microbe-derived organic carbon, we investigated the contribution of repeated microbial recycling to \textsuperscript{14}C ages throughout the profile. The model-experiments for this site lead to the following implications: Without rejuvenation by DOC transport, SOC in the subsoil would be on average 1700 \textsuperscript{14}C years older. Across the profile, SOC from microbial recycling is on average 1400 \textsuperscript{14}C years older than litter-derived SOC. Without microbial limitation of depolymerization, SOC in the subsoil would be on average 610 \textsuperscript{14}C years younger. Sorptive stabilization is responsible for relatively high \textsuperscript{14}C ages in the topsoil. The model-experiments further indicate that the high SOC concentrations in the Bh horizon are caused by the interplay between sorptive stabilization and microbial dynamics. Overall, the model-experiments demonstrate that the high \textsuperscript{14}C ages are not solely caused by slow turnover of a single pool, but that the increase of \textsuperscript{14}C ages along a soil profile up to ages {$>$}1000 years is the result of different mechanisms contributing to the overall persistence of SOC. The dominant reasons for the persistence of SOC are stabilization processes, followed by repeated microbial processing of SOC.},

  abstract = {During the last decade, a paradigmatic shift regarding which processes determine the persistence of soil organic matter (SOM) took place. The interaction between microbial decomposition and association of organic matter with the soil mineral matrix has been identified as a focal point for understanding the formation of stable SOM. Using an improved version of the vertically resolved SOM model COMISSION (Ahrens et al., 2015), this paper investigates the effect of a maximum sorption capacity (Qmax) for mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) formation and its interaction with microbial processes, such as microbial decomposition and microbial necromass production. We define and estimate the maximum sorption capacity Qmax with quantile regressions between mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC) and the clay plus silt ({$<$}20 μm) content. In the COMISSION v2.0 model, plant- and microbial-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) and dead microbial cell walls can sorb to mineral surfaces up to Qmax. MAOC can only be decomposed by microorganisms after desorption. We calibrated the COMISSION v2.0 model with data from ten different sites with widely varying textures and Qmax values. COMISSION v2.0 was able to fit the MAOC and SOC depth profiles, as well as the respective 14C gradients with soil depth across these sites. Using the generic set of parameters retrieved in the multi-site calibration, we conducted model experiments to isolate the effects of varying Qmax, point-of-entry of litter inputs, and soil temperature. Across the ten sites, the combination of depolymerization limitation of microorganisms due to substrate scarcity in the subsoil and the size of Qmax explain 14C depth gradients in OC.},

  abstract = {The relationship between stream water DOC concentrations and soil organic C pools was investigated at a range of spatial scales in subcatchments of the River Dee system in north-east Scotland. Catchment percentage peat cover and soil C pools, calculated using local, national and international soils databases, were related to mean DOC concentrations in streams draining small- (55km2), medium- (12±38 km2) and large-scale (56±150 km2) catchments. The results show that, whilst soil C pool is a good predictor of stream water DOC concentration at all three scales, the strongest relationships were found in the small-scale catchments. In addition, in both the small- and large-scale catchments, percentage peat cover was as a good predictor of stream water DOC concentration as catchment soil C pool. The data also showed that, for a given soil C pool, streams draining lowland (5700 m) catchments had higher DOC concentrations than those draining upland (4700 m) catchments, suggesting that disturbance and land use may have a small e?ect on DOC concentration. Our results therefore suggest that the relationship between stream water DOC concentration and catchment soil C pools exists at a range of spatial scales and this relationship appears to be su?ciently robust to be used to predict the e?ects of changes in catchment soil C storage on stream water DOC concentration.},

  abstract = {Purpose The sensitivity of soil organic carbon to global change drivers, according to the depth profile, is receiving increasing attention because of its importance in the global carbon cycle and its potential feedback to climate change. A better knowledge of the vertical distribution of SOC and its controlling factors—the aim of this study—will help scientists predict the consequences of global change. Materials and methods The study area was the Murcia Province (S.E. Spain) under semiarid Mediterranean conditions. The database used consists of 312 soil profiles collected in a systematic grid, each 12 km 2 covering a total area of 11,004 km 2 . Statistical analysis to study the relationships between SOC concentration and control factors in different soil use scenarios was conducted at fixed depths of 0–20, 20–40, 40–60, and 60–100 cm. Results and discussion SOC concentration in the top 40 cm ranged between 6.1 and 31.5 gkg −1 , with significant differences according to land use, soil type and lithology, while below this depth, no differences were observed (SOC concentration 2.1–6.8 gkg −1 ). The ANOVA showed that land use was the most important factor controlling SOC concentration in the 0–40 cm depth. Significant differences were found in the relative importance of environmental and textural factors according to land use and soil depth. In forestland, mean annual precipitation and texture were the main predictors of SOC, while in cropland and shrubland, the main predictors were mean annual temperature and lithology. Total SOC stored in the top 1 m in the region was about 79 Tg with a low mean density of 7.18 kgCm −3 . The vertical distribution of SOC was shallower in forestland and deeper in cropland. A reduction in rainfall would lead to SOC decrease in forestland and shrubland, and an increase of mean annual temperature would adversely affect SOC in croplands and shrubland. With increasing depth, the relative importance of climatic factors decreases and texture becomes more important in controlling SOC in all land uses. Conclusions Due to climate change, impacts will be much greater in surface SOC, the strategies for C sequestration should be focused on subsoil sequestration, which was hindered in forestland due to bedrock limitations to soil depth. In these conditions, sequestration in cropland through appropriate management practices is recommended.},

  abstract = {The accurate measurement of the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock in Australian grazing lands is important due to the major role that SOC plays in soil productivity and the potential influence of soil C cycling on Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. However, the current sampling methodologies for SOC stock are varied and potentially conflicting. It was the objective of this paper to review the nature of, and reasons for, SOC variability; the sampling methodologies commonly used; and to identify knowledge gaps for SOC measurement in grazing lands. Soil C consists of a range of biological materials, in various SOC pools such as dissolved organic C, micro- and meso-fauna (microbial biomass), fungal hyphae and fresh plant residues in or on the soil (particulate organic C, light-fraction C), the products of decomposition (humus, slow pool C) and complexed organic C, and char and phytoliths (inert, passive or resistant C); and soil inorganic C (carbonates and bicarbonates). Microbial biomass and particulate or light-fraction organic C are most sensitive to management or land-use change; resistant organic C and soil carbonates are least sensitive. The SOC present at any location is influenced by a series of complex interactions between plant growth, climate, soil type or parent material, topography and site management. Because of this, SOC stock and SOC pools are highly variable on both spatial and temporal scales. This creates a challenge for efficient sampling. Sampling methods are predominantly based on design-based (classical) statistical techniques, crucial to which is a randomised sampling pattern that negates bias. Alternatively a model-based (geostatistical) analysis can be used, which does not require randomisation. Each approach is equally valid to characterise SOC in the rangelands. However, given that SOC reporting in the rangelands will almost certainly rely on average values for some aggregated scale (such as a paddock or property), we contend that the design-based approach might be preferred. We also challenge soil surveyors and their sponsors to realise that: (i) paired sites are the most efficient way of detecting a temporal change in SOC stock, but destructive sampling and cumulative measurement errors decrease our ability to detect change; (ii) due to (i), an efficient sampling scheme to estimate baseline status is not likely to be an efficient sampling scheme to estimate temporal change; (iii) samples should be collected as widely as possible within the area of interest; (iv) replicate of laboratory analyses is a critical step in being able to characterise temporal change. Sampling requirements for SOC stock in Australian grazing lands are yet to be explicitly quantified and an examination of a range of these ecosystems is required in order to assess the sampling densities and techniques necessary to detect specified changes in SOC stock and SOC pools. An examination of techniques that can help reduce sampling requirements (such as measurement of the SOC fractions that are most sensitive to management changes and/or measurement at specific times of the year – preferably before rapid plant growth – to decrease temporal variability), and new technologies for in situ SOC measurement is also required.},

  abstract = {The need to stabilize the greenhouse gas concentrations of the atmosphere is the great environmental challenge of this century. To control these concentrations, humanity can reduce fossil fuel emissions and/or identify mechanisms to remove greenhouse gases once they have been emitted. The scope of the problem is challenging because of the size of the fluxes involved. Presently, industry, transportation, and domestic use emits nearly 10 Gt CO2 to the atmosphere annually, and there is no immediate hope for a drastic reversal of these rates of emission (1). Thus, sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide as organic carbon in the biosphere attracts attention as an alternate way to help stem the rate of greenhouse gas growth and associated changes in our climate. Some soil researchers have suggested that altered agricultural techniques can help restore much carbon to domesticated soils, thus helping mitigate climate change. But cultural and scientific challenges suggest that this proposition is overly optimistic and inherently flawed. Image courtesy of ScienceSource/Jerry Irwin. For nearly 2 decades, researchers in the soil science community have studied and estimated the potential of sequestering carbon in soil organic matter (2, 3). The premise is inherently rational: nearly 10,000 years of cultivated agriculture has reduced global soil carbon by 116 Gt (4), an amount equivalent to more than a decade of the present rates of industrial emissions. Through changed agricultural techniques, it is proposed, much of this carbon can be restored to domesticated soils and thus serve as a significant tool to mitigate climate change, providing a wider timeframe for society to decarbonize. Unfortunately, both cultural and scientific challenges suggest that this proposal is overly optimistic and inherently flawed. Nevertheless, this long and relatively well-funded (5) area of research recently gained novel international exposure because of the unveiling of the French “4 per \textbackslash ldots [↵][1]1To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The method, which is based on the initial respiratory response of microbial populations to amendment with an excess of a carbon and energy source, was quantified using an expanded version of Jenkinson's technique. The simultaneous application of the two methods to 50 soil samples showed a highly significant correlation (r = 0.96) between both. From this correlation it could be deduced that at 22°C, a substrate-induced maximal respiratory rate of 1 ml CO2· h-1 corresponds to c. 40 mg microbial biomass C. Evidence supporting these results was obtained from pure culture studies. The various soil types investigated were collected from agricultural as well as forest sites and they contained between 15 and 240 mg microbial C·100g dry soil-1. The respiratory method provides reproducible estimates of biomass size within 1-3 h after soil amendment. It can be combined without difficulty with a selective inhibition method for determination of bacterial and fungal contributions to soil metabolism. © 1978.},

  abstract = {Soil respiration is the sum of respiration processes in the soil and is a major flux in the global carbon cycle. It is usually assumed that the CO2 efflux is equal to the soil respiration rate. Here we challenge this assumption by combining measurements of CO2 with high-precision measurements of O2. These measurements were conducted on different ecosystems and soil types and included measurements of air samples taken from the soil profile of three Mediterranean sites: a temperate forest and two alpine forests. Root-free soils from the alpine sites were also incubated in the lab. We found that the ratio between the CO2 efflux and the O2 influx (defined as apparent respiratory quotient, ARQ) was in the range of 0.14 to 1.23 and considerably deviated from the value of 0.9 ± 0.1 expected from the elemental composition of average plants and soil organic matter. At the Mediterranean sites, these deviations are explained as a result of CO2 dissolution in the soil water and transformation to bicarbonate ions in these high-pH soils, as well as by carbonate mineral dissolution and precipitation processes. Thus, a correct estimate of the short-term, chamber-based biological respiratory flux in such soils can only be made by dividing the measured soil CO2 efflux by the average (efflux-weighted) soil profile ARQ. Applying this approach to a semiarid pine forest resulted in an estimated short-term biological respiration rate that is 3.8 times higher than the chamber-measured surface CO2. The ARQ values often observed in the more acidic soils were unexpectedly low (},

It is thus crucial to better identify the location of SOC from different sources for the parameterization of SOC models, especially in the less investigated subsoils. The aim of this study was to spatially assess contributions of organic carbon from aboveground and belowground parts of beech trees to subsoil organic carbon in a Dystric Cambisol. Different sources of SOC were distinguished by solvent-extractable and hydrolysable lipid biomarkers aided by (14)C analyses of soil compartments {$<$}63 μm. We found no effect of the distance to the trees on the investigated parameters. Instead, a vertical zonation of the subsoil was detected. A high contribution of fresh leaf- and root-derived organic carbon to the upper subsoil (leaf- and root-affected zone) indicate that supposedly fast-cycling, leaf-derived SOC may still be of considerable importance below the A-horizon. In the deeper subsoil (root-affected zone), roots were an important source of fresh SOC. Simultaneously, strongly increasing apparent (14)C ages (3860 yrs BP) indicate considerable contribution of SOC that may be inherited from the Pleistocene parent material.},

To reveal potential effects varying parent materials exert on SOC stocks, we investigated chemical (14C content and overall chemical composition via 13C NMR spectroscopy) and plant/microbial related parameters (root mass, amino sugars) of bulk soil and soil organic matter fractions from topsoil, subsoil, and rhizosphere soil at three European beech stands (Fagus sylvatica L.) only differing in parent material (Tertiary sand, Quaternary loess, and Tertiary basalt). The results suggest that the clay fraction, its amount being largely dependent on the respective parent material, took a central role in shaping differences in SOC stocks among the investigated sites by affecting soil organic matter stabilization via organo-mineral association and aggregation. This fraction was particularly relevant in the subsoil, where it accounted for up to 80\% of the bulk soil SOC stocks that decreased with decreasing amounts of the clay fraction (basalt {$>$} loess {$>$} sand site). Determining the soil's nutrient composition, parent material likely also indirectly affected SOC stocks by changing rhizosphere traits (such as fine root density or mortality) and by attracting root growth (and thus organic matter inputs) to subsoil with higher nutrient contents, where in situ root inputs in the form of rhizodeposits were likely the prime source of plant-derived SOC. However, root inputs also contributed in large part to topsoil SOC stocks and were associated with higher abundance of microbial compounds (amino sugars), whose relative importance increased with increasing soil depth. Independent of soil depth and site, amino sugars and the amount of the clay fraction, combined with parameters related to the input of organic matter (root mass and amount of the particulate organic matter fraction) explained more than 90\% of the variability in SOC stocks, indicating a key role of these measures in impacting SOC stocks. Because parent material directly or indirectly influenced these parameters, we demonstrate the necessity to consider differences in parent material when estimating and predicting SOC stocks.},

The experiments had similar field plans, with four levels of compaction created by tractor traffic, and were usually sown with barley (Hordeum vulgare, L.). Soil from 70 of the sites were ground and passed through a 2mm sieve, and then compressed in a uniaxial compression test. The data were used to study the influence of soil texture and organic matter content on soil physical properties and crop yield in the field and after uniaxial compression. In the field, bulk density decreased while air content increased with increasing organic matter content. On soils with {$>$}50gkg−1 organic matter all traffic treatments on average increased yield compared to untrafficked soil, while yield in the most compacted treatment was 11\% lower on soils with {$<$}30gkg−1 organic matter. The compression index in the field was virtually unaffected by soil texture and organic matter content, while the compression index obtained in the uniaxial test was positively correlated to the clay content. Contrary to the field results, a high organic matter content was not correlated to a decrease in the degree of compactness or an increase in air content in the uniaxial compression test. Compression was greater in the laboratory than in the field, especially at high stress levels and for soils with high clay and organic matter content. The experiments demonstrate the importance of organic matter to reduce negative effects of compaction. They also demonstrate the difficulty in assessing soil susceptibility to compaction from a traditional uniaxial compression test.},

  abstract = {Adsorption of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to mineral surfaces is an important process determining DOM bioavailability and carbon sequestration in soils. However, little is known about preferential adsorption of DOM at the molecular level. In this study, DOM originating from composted biosolids was analyzed in order to elucidate DOM adsorptive fractionation by clay soil. Structural changes in DOM due to adsorption to soil were studied using two complementary approaches: (i) macroscale analysis including resin separation and (ii) molecular characterization using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). Both approaches demonstrated consistency regarding the DOM adsorptive fractionation. Resin separation showed preferential adsorption of the hydrophobic acid (HoA) fraction by soil surfaces, with up to 70\% of total adsorbed carbon; this fraction was apparently responsible for low DOM desorption. FT-ICR MS data demonstrated preferential adsorption of polyphenols, which are components of the HoA fraction. Adsorption of highly oxidized, saturated “carbohydrate-like” molecules was also observed, which might be a result of adsorption of the hydrophilic neutral (HiN) fraction. DOM exhibited concentration-dependent fractionation: enhanced adsorption of highly oxidized compounds at low DOM concentrations, and selective adsorption of less oxidized components at higher DOM concentrations, suggesting that adsorptive fractionation of DOM depended on the extent of its loading. Our findings suggest that a significant amount of carbon originating from the applied DOM was irreversibly stabilized by mineral surfaces. The study demonstrates that both DOM chemical heterogeneity and DOM concentration need to be considered in order to predict DOM reactivity and carbon stabilization in soils.},

We hypothesized that tillage and N-fertilizer managements induced changes in SOC at the surface 0–15 cm soil would predominantly be reflected by parallel changes in different fractions of SOC. Three field experiments (Expt1: 2008–2011, Expt2: 2005– 2011, Expt3: 2005–2011) were conducted in a Fargo (Typic Epiaquerts)-Ryan (Typic Natraquerts) silty clay complex in Fargo, North Dakota, USA. Our objectives were (i) to evaluate the effects of tillage (conventional till [CT], strip till [ST] and no-till [NT] and different N-fertilizer managements on SOC, CPOM-C, KMnO4-C, MBC, and Cmin and (ii) to determine any relationships among these C fractions within corn (Zea mays)-sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris)-soybean (Glycine max) rotation. Compared with CT, ST and NT had significantly higher SOC concentration by 3.8 and 2.7\%, SOC stock by 7.2\% and 9.2\%, CPOM-C by 22 and 25\%, and KMnO4-C by 4.8 and 4.1\%, respectively in Expt2 and had significantly higher SOC concentration by 3.9 and 6.6\%, SOC stock by 11.9 and 8.7\%, and CPOM-C by 33 and 45\%, respectively in Expt3.

Across the study, CPOM-C was 16.3–22.1\%, MBC was 3.4–4.5\%, cumulative Cmin was 0.7–1.4\%, and KMnO4-C was 1.6–1.7\% of the total SOC. Significant correlations were observed among SOC, CPOM-C and Cmin in all the experiments. CPOM-C was the most sensitive fraction to tillage changes. Tillage influences on SOC fractions followed the order: physical (CPOM-C) {$>$} biological (cumulative Cmin) {$>$} chemical (KMnO4-C), however, the sequence change with soil type and crop rotation requires further investigation.},

  abstract = {Lignin transformation and decomposition products are generally considered a major source of stable soil organic matter (SOM). Nevertheless this process remains poorly understood in part because lignin is a heterogeneous biopolymer composed of several types of phenol monomers, which potentially display specific and contrasting decomposition kinetics in soils. Here, we compared the specific in situ turnover kinetics of individual lignin monomers in a Paris-basin loamy soil through natural 13C labeling of SOM generated in a series of 1-9-year chronosequences of maize monoculture (C4, δ13C -12‰) replacing wheat (C3, -27‰). Lignin monomers were released by CuO oxidation, quantified by gas chromatography (GC)/flame ionization detection (FID) and their 13C content was determined by GC coupled via a combustion interface to isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/C-IRMS). We calculated the proportion of C4-derived OC in lignin monomer pools by applying the isotopic mass balance equation to each lignin monomer. Individual C4-derived phenols displayed contrasting accumulation rates in soils over time, confirming the monomer-specific nature of their transformation kinetics. In proportion to total lignin phenols in soils, syringyl (S) and cinnamyl (C) phenols from maize accumulated faster than their vanillyl (V) counterparts. Consequently, the turnover kinetics of lignin-derived V-moieties may be slower than those of S and C ones. Incorporation of maize-derived carbon was faster in the aldehyde than in the acid pool for V-type units, while the opposite was observed for S-units. These in situ trends for phenol monomers and V-, S- and C-moieties were remarkably similar to the trends described in the literature with laboratory incubation or litterbag studies. None of the observed kinetics had a linear shape. Using only the extreme points of the chronosequence to calculate the kinetic parameters would result, for all the lignin monomers, in underestimating the turnover kinetics at the beginning of the kinetics and overestimating it for longer times. This observation underlines the importance of comprehensive 13C time-sequence labelling experiments such as provided at the Closeaux site, to accurately compute the kinetic parameters of SOM for the 1st years after the vegetation change. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {In 1959, Athol Rafter began a substantial programme of systematically monitoring the flow of 14C produced by atmospheric thermonuclear tests through organic matter in New Zealand soils under stable land use. A database of ∼500 soil radiocarbon measurements spanning 50 years has now been compiled, and is used here to identify optimal approaches for soil C-cycle studies. Our results confirm the potential of 14C to determine residence times, by estimating the amount of 'bomb 14C' incorporated. High-resolution time series confirm this approach is appropriate, and emphasise that residence times can be calculated routinely with two or more time points as little as 10 years apart. This approach is generally robust to the key assumptions that can create large errors when single time-point 14C measurements are modelled. The three most critical assumptions relate to: (1) the distribution of turnover times, and particularly the proportion of old C ('passive fraction'), (2) the lag time between photosynthesis and C entering the modelled pool, (3) changes in the rates of C input. When carrying out approaches using robust assumptions on time-series samples, multiple soil layers can be aggregated using a mixing equation. Where good archived samples are available, AMS measurements can develop useful understanding for calibrating models of the soil C cycle at regional to continental scales with sample numbers on the order of hundreds rather than thousands. Sample preparation laboratories and AMS facilities can play an important role in coordinating the efficient delivery of robust calculated residence times for soil carbon. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The exchange of carbon between soil organic carbon (SOC) and the atmosphere affects the climate1,2and—because of the importance of organic matter to soil fertility—agricultural productivity3. The dynamics of topsoil carbon has been relatively well quantified4, but half of the soil carbon is located in deeper soil layers (below 30 centimetres)5–7, and many questions remain regarding the exchange of this deep carbon with the atmosphere8. This knowledge gap restricts soil carbon management policies and limits global carbon models1,9,10. Here we quantify the recent incorporation of atmosphere-derived carbon atoms into whole-soil profiles, through a meta-analysis of changes in stable carbon isotope signatures at 112 grassland, forest and cropland sites, across different climatic zones, from 1965 to 2015. We find, in agreement with previous work5,6, that soil at a depth of 30–100 centimetres beneath the surface (the subsoil) contains on average 47 per cent of the topmost metre's SOC stocks. However, we show that this subsoil accounts for just 19 per cent of the SOC that has been recently incorporated (within the past 50 years) into the topmost metre. Globally, the median depth of recent carbon incorporation into mineral soil is 10 centimetres. Variations in the relative allocation of carbon to deep soil layers are better explained by the aridity index than by mean annual temperature. Land use for crops reduces the incorporation of carbon into the soil surface layer, but not into deeper layers. Our results suggest that SOC dynamics and its responses to climatic control or land use are strongly dependent on soil depth. We propose that using multilayer soil modules in global carbon models, tested with our data, could help to improve our understanding of soil–atmosphere carbon exchange.},

Radiocarbon (14C) derived from atmospheric nuclear weapons testing was used to trace the incorporation of C into the soil and sources of C in the soil CO2 flux from the soil surface and deeper layers. Larger values of 14CO2 in surface flux were found at the afforested site (109–110 per cent modern (pM) compared with 107–108 pM at the grassland site). Surface litter fractions (Oi horizon) from the afforested site showed larger 14C signatures than the equivalent fractions in the grassland (113–115 pM in the forest compared with 106–109 pM in the grassland). Fine root fractions ({$<$}2 mm, Oe horizon) had similar signatures at both sites (109 pM in the forest compared with 109–111 pM in the grassland). Humified fractions at 10-cm depth (Oa horizon) showed smaller signatures (100–103 pM) in the forest than the equivalent fraction in the grassland soil (106–114 pM). According to a mixing model that takes into account pool size and 14C signature, the contributions to surface CO2 fluxes from slow turnover fractions that had resided in the soil for more than one year were greater at the forested site than the grassland site, but contributions from fast-turnover C fixed within the year prior to study showed the opposite trend. The results, taken together with previous work indicating that both site preparation and clear-felling lead to a net loss of C, indicate that long-term fixation in deep soil organic fractions is limited on this soil type under plantation forest over 40–50-year commercial rotations.},

  abstract = {Rewetting dry soils is associated with a burst of microbial activity and mineralization, which manifests itself as a pulse in soil CO2 emissions, long-known as the Birch effect. In arid and semi-arid systems, soil CO2 losses upon rewetting at the end of extended dry periods can contribute a significant fraction to the overall carbon (C) budget. Microbial biomass is one of the sources of mineralized C, as was demonstrated over 30 years ago (Kieft et al., 1987). The present paper offers a perspective on how the field has progressed since the 1987 paper was published in Soil Biology \& Biochemistry, what it means in terms of current concerns about global climate change, and the needs and potential emphases of future research. Many studies since 1987 have addressed the origin of this CO2 pulse, finding multiple possible C sources involving both biotic and abiotic processes. We propose that the magnitude of the rewetting event (Δψ) determines the relative contribution from the array of substrates that contribute to the soil CO2 pulse upon rewetting. The magnitude of the CO2 pulse is likely related to soil physical characteristics and to the size of the available C pool, which is partly controlled by plants. Further, the relative contributions of the mechanisms generating soil CO2 pulses upon rewetting are likely to be modified by climate change. To understand and predict the magnitude of soil CO2 pulses upon rewetting, we advocate continued cross-disciplinary research involving soil microbial ecology, soil physics, soil chemistry, as well as increased integration and recognition of the importance of plant-soil interactions in controlling the soil C pools contributing to soil CO2 pulses.},

  abstract = {Soil mineral phases strongly influence soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. Clay-size particles have been recognized as protecting SOC from microbial decomposition. Among clay-size minerals, phyllosilicates (clay minerals) have been shown to efficiently protect SOC. There is an important variety of phyllosilicate types present in soils which have contrasting surface properties (specific surface area, charge density). Although these differing surface properties should influence their ability in protecting SOC, this has not been clearly established yet. Publications comparing the ability of the different phyllosilicates to protect SOC are reviewed in this study. Relatively few studies dealing with the link between phyllosilicate mineralogy and SOC protection exist. The few existing studies have followed different methodologies and are based on various analytical techniques, such that direct comparisons among them are difficult. More problematic, they provide different conclusions. Indeed, if experiments conducted in suspension using pure clay phases and recent meta-analyses suggest that phyllosilicate mineralogy has a significant importance for SOC stabilization and SOC stock response to land-use change, these results are not clearly corroborated by studies conducted on a reduced number of soils. The recent technical developments which allow improving both quantitative and qualitative descriptions of the soil clay mineral assemblages, together with nanoscale investigations of phyllosilicate/OM interactions, offer exciting perspectives for determining more accurately the efficiency of the different phyllosilicate types in SOC protection. Such information may provide a much clearer understanding of the impact of phyllosilicate mineralogy on SOC dynamics in the coming years. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {© 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland. A large fraction of soil organic matter (OM) resists decomposition over decades to centuries as indicated by long radiocarbon residence times, but the mechanisms responsible for the long-term (multi-decadal) persistence are debated. The current lack of mechanistic understanding limits our ability to accurately predict soil OM stock evolution under climate and land-use changes. Using a unique set of historic soil samples from five long-term (27–79 years) bare fallow experiments, we demonstrate that despite wide pedo-climatic diversity, persistent OM shows specific energetic signatures, but no uniform chemical composition. From an energetic point of view, thermal analyses revealed that combustion of persistent OM occurred at higher temperature and provided less energy than combustion of more labile OM. In terms of chemical composition, persistent OM was H-depleted compared to OM present at the start of bare fallow, but spectroscopic analyses of OM functional groups did not reflect a consistent chemical composition of OM across sites, nor substantial modifications with bare fallow duration. The low energy content of persistent OM may be attributed to a combination of reduced content of energetic C–H bonds or stronger interactions between OM and the mineral matrix. Soil microorganisms thus appear to preferentially mineralize high-energy OM, leaving behind material with low energy content. This study provides the first direct link between long-term persistence of OM in soil and the energetic barriers experienced by the decomposer community.},

  abstract = {Our study tests the emerging paradigm that biochemical recalcitrance does not affect substantially long-term (50 years) SOC persistence. We analyzed the molecular composition of SOC in archived soils originating from four European long-term bare fallow experiments (Askov, Rothamsted, Versailles and Ultuna). The soils had been collected after various periods (up to 53 years) under bare fallow. With increasing duration of bare fallow without new organic inputs, the relative abundance of cutin- and suberin-derived compounds declined substantially, and the abundance of lignin-derived compounds was close to zero. Conversely, the relative abundance of plant-derived long-chain alkanes remained almost constant or increased during the bare fallow period. The relative abundance of N-containing compounds, considered to be abundant in SOC derived from microbial activity, increased consistently illustrating that microbial turnover of SOC continues even when plant inputs are stopped. The persistence of the different families of plant-derived compounds differed markedly over the scale of half a century, which may be ascribed to their contrasting chemical characteristics and recalcitrance, or to differences in their interactions with the soil mineral matrix, and likely some combination since chemical composition drives the degree of mineral association. Using soil from this unique set of long-term bare fallow experiments, we provide direct evidence that multi-decadal scale persistent SOC is enriched in microbe-derived compounds but also includes a substantial fraction of plant-derived compounds.},

We adapted the classical density fractionation procedure and focused on the heavy fractions ({$>$} 1.9), which we divided into eight organomineral fractions. We characterized them simultaneously through non-destructive mineralogical analyses (XRD and NMR of Al and Si) and organic carbon analyses. The results showed that the largest proportion (82.6\%) of organic matter in the horizon was associated with minerals in organomineral complexes. Imogolite type materials bound 6-fold more OM than anorthoclase, and 3.5-fold more OM than iron oxides. In addition, we observed a degree of polymerization of imogolite type materials that was midway between that of allophane and Al in Al-humus complexes. In conclusion, the results of this density fractionation combined with a mineralogical approach suggested that OM in the heavy fractions could be divided into several pools depending on the nature of the minerals. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The study site was an arable field in Southern Germany under integrated farming management including reduced tillage. Samples of this Eutric Cambisol soil were taken in July 2001, October 2001, April 2002 and July 2002 and separated into three depths according to the soil profile (0-10 cm, 10-28 cm and 28-40 cm). For each sample, the quantity and quality (humification index, HIX) of water extractable organic matter (WEOM) were measured concomitantly with soil enzyme activities (alkaline phosphatase, ??-glucosidase, protease) and microbial community size (Cmic). Furthermore, microbial community structure was characterised based on the fingerprints of nucleic acids (DNA) as well as phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA). We observed strong influences of sampling date and depth on the measured parameters, with depth accounting for more of the observed variability than date. Increasing depth resulted in decreases in all parameters, while seasonal effects differed among variants. Principal component (PC) analysis revealed that both DNA and PLFA fingerprints differentiated among microbial communities from different depths, and to a smaller extent, sampling dates. The majority of the 10 PLFAs contributing most to PC 1 were specific for anaerobes. Enzyme activities were strongly related to Cmic, which was depending on water extractable organic carbon and nitrogen (WEOC and WEON) but not to HIX. HIX and WEOM interact with the microbial community, illustrated by (1) the correlation with the number of PLFA peaks (community richness), and (2) the correlations with community PC analysis scores. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Climate change itself is widely accepted as reality now, and the strong demand of the modeling community for reliable data of the carbon pool—especially in soils—has been maintained. With the steadily increasing capacity of 14 C dating facilities, these data can be and are produced. Nevertheless, they still cannot be accessed easily and equally enough. Now, decreased costs of hardware and recent developments of the internet enable the IRSDB to be implemented, in a joint effort. As a seed, a test server has been set up, with open-source software, housing the database in alpha-stage, a web interface, and a community portal. Thus, the development of the design as well as the data input of the database is done in close collaboration of the users of the database, the laboratories, soil scientists, archaeologists, modelers, other scientists, and interested laypersons. In order to guarantee the longtime independence of the availability and usability of the database from vendors or changing standards, only widely used open-source software and open standards are used. Therefore, the development of plug-ins for data input from laboratory databases or output to different required formats as well as interfaces to GIS and other software is possible.

Sampling costs were also compared. Coring methods significantly underestimated RF content at all rocky sites, but significant differences (p {$<$} 0.05) in SOC stocks between pits and corers were only found with the hammer method using the fixeddepth approach at the {$<$} 0.01 m 3 m -3 RF site (pit, 5.80 kg C m -2 ; hammer, 4.74 g C m -2 ) and at the 0.14 m 3 m -3 RF site (pit, 8.81 kg C m -2 ; hammer, 6.71 kg C m -2 ). The hammer corer also underestimated rb at all sites as did the hydraulic push corer at the 0.21 m 3 m -3 RF site. No significant differences in mass-based SOC stock estimates were observed between pits and corers. Our results indicate that (i) calculating SOC stocks on a mass basis can overcome biases in RF and rb estimates introduced by sampling equipment and (ii) a quantitative pit is the optimal sampling method for establishing reference soil masses, followed by rotary and then hydraulic push corers.}

Soil carbon sequestration on arable lands is a negative emissions technology with high climate change mitigation potential that also confers agronomic co-benefits, but variability of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks remains both a statistical and financial challenge for verifying SOC sequestration goals. This work is in two parts: 1) improving sampling methods for SOC assessment on rocky soils, and 2) reducing sampling requirements for mapping and modeling field-scale subsoil, topsoil and whole profile SOC stocks via remote and proximal sensing. Part 1 shows that hammer corers bias SOC stock estimates, while rotary corers are more accurate on rocky soils; and that SOC stocks should be calculated and reported on a mass-basis for improved accuracy and precision. Part 2 shows that proximal sensing with tractor-mounted visual/near-infrared spectroscopy (VNIR-p) is an effective approach for stratification and mapping of topsoil (0-0.30 m) and profile (0-0.75 m) SOC stocks with a reduced sample number (n=12 cores); however, due to the greater spatial covariance of SOC stocks over shorter distances in subsoil compared to topsoil, VNIR-p does not adequately capture the distribution of SOC stocks in subsoil.},

Incubating archived soils enriched by “bomb-C” from mid-20th century nuclear weapons testing would be even more powerful as it would enable us to trace this pulse over time. However, air-drying and subsequent rewetting of archived soils, as well as storage duration, may alter the relative contribution to respiration from soil carbon pools with different cycling rates. We designed three experiments to assess air-drying and rewetting effects on ∆14C-CO2 with constant storage duration (Experiment 1), without storage (Experiment 2), and with variable storage duration (Experiment 3). We found that air-drying and rewetting led to small but significant (α {$<$} 0.05) shifts in ∆14C-CO2 relative to undried controls in all experiments, with grassland soils responding more strongly than forest soils. Storage duration (4–14 y) did not have a substantial effect. Mean differences (95\% CIs) for experiments 1, 2, and 3 were: 23.3‰ (±6.6), 19.6‰ (±10.3), and 29.3‰ (±29.1) for grassland soils, versus −11.6‰ (±4.1), 12.7‰ (±8.5), and −24.2‰ (±13.2) for forest soils. Our results indicate that air-drying and rewetting soils mobilizes a slightly older pool of carbon that would otherwise be inaccessible to microbes, an effect that persists throughout the incubation. However, as the bias in ∆14C-CO2 from air-drying and rewetting is small, measuring ∆14C-CO2 in incubations of archived soils appears to be a promising technique for constraining soil carbon models.},

In contrast to common regression approaches based on features from digital terrain analysis, ConMap is not based on standard terrain attributes, but on elevation differences from the centre pixel to each pixel in circular neighbourhoods only. These differences are used as features in random forest regressions. We applied and validated the framework by predicting topsoil silt content in a loess region of 1150 km2 in Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse, Germany. Three hundred and forty-two samples and a 20-m resolution digital elevation model were used for this illustration and validation. We compared ConMap with standard and multi-scale terrain analysis approaches as well as with ordinary kriging interpolations. Cross-validation root mean square error (RMSE) decreased from 16.1 when the standard digital terrain analysis was used to 11.2 when ConMap was used. This corresponds to an increase in variance explained (R2) from 15 to 61\%. Even though ordinary kriging out-performed standard terrain analysis as well, the variance explained was 6\% smaller compared with that using ConMap. The results show that the geomorphic settings in the study area must have induced the spatial trend, which can be accounted for by ConMap over different scales. We conclude that ConMap shows great potential for digital soil mapping studies.},

Yet, most investigations have only studied the effects of agricultural management on soil carbon in surface layers ({$<$} 0.3m). Current soil organic carbon (SOC), total soil nitrogen (TN) and plant available phosphorus (P Olsen) to a depth of 1.2m was measured at two long-term (9 and 18 years) farming systems experiments in southern Manitoba, Canada. Both experiments compared an annual-crop rotation, an alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)/crop rotation and re-established perennial grassland. At one site the two cropping systems were managed conventionally as well as in adherence to organic farming guidelines, but without manure additions. Due to higher net primary productivity and higher carbon inputs, particularly below ground, SOC stocks (0-120cm) were 21-65tCha -1 higher under the re-established grassland than cropping systems at the clay soil site after 18 years, but not at the site with sandy loam soil after 9 years. On the clay soil, 30-40\% of the additional C in the soil profile under the re-established grassland was found below 30cm indicating the capacity of deep plant roots to sequester C in the sub-soil. Using alfalfa cut for hay in crop rotations did not increase SOC or N stocks compared to annual crop rotations, but plant-available P concentrations were depleted, especially under organic management. SOC was 25-30tCha -1 lower under organic than conventionally managed cropping systems, due to lower inputs of plant C (0.8tCha -1yr -1) over the life of the experiment. This highlights that without additional C inputs organic management can reduce SOC compared to conventional cropping systems unless C inputs are maintained which may require manure or compost additions. ?? 2012.},

The objective is to determine which acquisition method (NIR, MIR, in the field or in the laboratory) might be recommended for the purpose of C stock measurement with a particular interest in carbon credit trading. For this purpose, an optimal method has to satisfy the dual constraints of low-cost and high throughput analysis. The various methods proposed in the literature are compared. In order to make comparisons as reliable as possible, special attention has been paid to the conditions of data acquisition (sample prep- aration), and to calibration and validation procedures. In particular, whether the validation has been carried out on fully independent samples or on samples similar to the ones of the calibration set greatly influences the results. Also, for C stock measurement, it is absolutely necessary to measure the bias of the prediction in order to be conclusive about the feasibility of the method. However, only few researchers provide this parameter and we recommend including it as a matter of course in future reports. Finally, although MIR on dried and ground samples is the most accurate method, on-the-go and in-field sensors provide predictions accurate enough to show promise in being a valuable component of technologies that would be used for C-credit purposes. But in order to meet the cost/accuracy trade-off, the main issue using such field sensors is to be able to simultaneously measure the bulk density or, better, to directly measure the volumetric concentration of C in soil. This circumvents the costs of field extraction and laboratory analysis. This is the next great challenge to be met by soil scientists.},

By combining density fractionation with elemental and spectroscopic analyses, we showed that SOM in depositional settings is less transformed and better preserved than SOM in eroding landform positions. However, which environmental factors exert primary control on storage and persistence of SOM depended on the nature of the landform position considered. In an annual grassland watershed, protection of SOM by physical isolation inside aggregates and chemical association of organic matter (complexation) with soil minerals, as assessed by correlation with radiocarbon concentration, were more effective in the poorly drained, lowest-lying depositional landform positions, compared to well-drained landform positions in the upper parts of the watershed. Results of this study demonstrated that processes of soil erosion and deposition are important mechanisms of long-term OM stabilization.},

We incubated these soils for 60 days with glucose, alanine, and leaf litter, crossed with an inorganic N amendment equivalent to three times ambient concentrations. The organic substrates were isotopically labeled (13C), allowing us to determine the source of mineralized C and assess the priming effect. Enzyme activity increased as much as 13 times in the two deeper horizons (1.0-1.3, and 2.7-3.0 m) after the addition of the organic substrates, even though the deepest horizon had microbial biomass and microbial phospholipid fatty acids below the level of detection before the experiment. The deepest horizon (2.7-3.0 m) yielded the largest priming response under alanine, indicating that microorganisms in these soil horizons can become active in response to input of organic substrates. Inorganic N amendments significantly decreased the priming effect, suggesting that decomposition may not be N limited. However, alanine (organic N) yielded the highest priming effect at every soil depth, indicating the importance of differentiating effect of organic and inorganic N on decomposition. Distinct priming effects with depth suggest that portions of the soil profile can respond differently to organic inputs. Our findings indicate that the deep soil C pools might be more vulnerable to environmental or anthropogenic change than previously thought, potentially influencing net CO2exchange estimates between the land and the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Annual C input to soil is a major factor affecting soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. However different types of C-sources can have different behaviour, in relation to their chemical characteristics and how they interact with soil. Root-derived C, in particular, should be more efficient than other organic materials as a result of the physicochemical and biological characteristics of the surrounding environment, leading to a reduction in the C decomposition rate.To test this hypothesis, we considered a long-term experiment underway in Northern Italy since 1962, comparing permanent meadow and 6 different crop rotations over a wide range of nutrient inputs, in both organic and inorganic forms. C inputs from amendments were measured and those from crops were calculated using allometric functions and crop and residues yields. The time evolution of SOC was studied through a single-pool, first-order kinetic model, allowing the estimation of humification coefficients for residues, roots, farmyard manure and cattle slurries.The highest value of the humification coefficient was estimated for farmyard manure, which confirmed its high efficiency in stabilising SOC content. Root C presented a humification coefficient 1.9 times higher than above-ground plant materials while slurries were intermediate, with a humification coefficient roughly half that of farmyard manure and even lower that of roots.The quality of C input thus seems of fundamental importance for evaluating the sustainability of different cropping systems in terms of SOC dynamics.},

For the range of parameter values studied it was found that all the maximum annual flood peak dis- tributions are of extreme value 1 (Gumbel) type. The normalized distribution functions (growth curves) are remarkably similar over all the parameter sets considered. Runoff produc- tion in flood events for all the simulations was dominated by the saturation excess mechan- ism, even assuming very high hydraulic conductivities, and even where infiltration excess runoff is predicted as occurring over part of the catchment. It appears to be difficult to avoid surface saturation under the wet conditions associated with floods in a climatic regime typical of upland Britain.},

  abstract = {A complex system is defined by two aspects, first, a relatively large number of influencing factors, and second, a high degree of connectivity between these factors. The health of a soil can be viewed as a complex system. A range of multivariate analytical techniques have been applied in the past to gain a deeper understanding of the health of a soil. Network analyses and, in particular, asset or correlation graphs have not been applied in soil health studies before. In this article, we hypothesize that correlation graphs may provide valuable complementary information when multivariate soil data are analyzed for soil health purposes. We investigate the use of these tools in conjunction with principal component analysis (PCA) for assessing a multivariate soil health data set. A database containing 56 soil samples from three land-use types and with a wide range of physical, chemical, and biological soil property measurements was analyzed. Many expected relationships between soil properties were confirmed. Nematode genera are generally poorly correlated. Aggregate formation is regulated by clay content in a clayey soil, but by biological processes in sandy soils. Carbon correlated strongly with many other variables in virgin soils, but its influence diminishes in agricultural soils, especially when residues were burnt. In clayey soils where carbon levels were depleted, the correlation structure revolves around calcium and small soil aggregates, whereas correlation structures are low, and the degrees of freedom are high in similarly treated sandy soils. The statistical techniques that were applied seem to complement each other well and support a two-step multivariate analysis approach where PCA is first used to explore the strong relationships, and then correlation graphs are used to explore the weaker relationships in a data set. Pareto correlation graphs, which incorporate only the highest 20\% of correlation coefficients into a graph, appear particularly useful in depicting the larger aggregated manageability and measurability of soils.

  abstract = {Respirometer experiments show that when a dry soil is moistened a characteristic pattern of decomposition occurs in which an initial period of relatively rapid decomposition (Stage 1) falls, during a few days, to a slow steady rate (Stage 2). This pattern is repetitive with successive dryings and rewettings and is common to all soils so far investigated. The magnitude of decomposition depends in the percent carbon in the soil and on the drying conditions, air-drying being less effective than oven-drying. Decomposition during Stage 1 conforms approximately to a first-order reaction and proportionate amounts of nitrogen are mineralised. A similar pattern of decomposition occurs under field conditions throughout successive wet and dry seasons. Evidence is presented to show that decomposition involves direct microbial attack of the solid organic substrate and that the recurrent pattern of decomposition is due to the state in which the microbial population is left after drying and its subsequent behaviour on rewetting. The rapid decline in the rate of decomposition on rewetting (Stage 1) appears not to involve (1) the development of toxic conditions, (b) physical changes in the soil (since similar patterns of decomposition also occur with organic material alone or in sand) or (c) rapid decomposition of organic material made soluble by drying. The operation and repetition of this pattern of decomposition in the field has important consequences in the rundown of soil carbon and the mineralisation of soil nitrogen particularly where well-defined wet and dry seasons occur. These consequences are discussed in relation to climate and certain agricultural practices. © 1959 Martinus Nijhoff.},

In addition, the possibility of improving the prediction quality by the use of additional samples from the top and/or bottom of soil profiles along with horizon data is examined. The predictive performance of the splines is compared with that of exponential decay functions, and 1st and 2nd degree polynomials. In addition, the predictive quality of the conventional horizon data is examined. The measure of predictive performance used is the root mean square error values calculated from differences between the 'true' depth function and the fitted depth function. The 'true' depth functions were derived from the intensive sampling and laboratory analysis of soil profiles. Three soil profiles were sampled; a Red Podzolic Soil (Red Kurosol), Podzol (Aeric Podosol) and Krasnozem (Red Ferrosol). The soil attributes that were measured included; pH, electrical conductivity (EC), clay \%, sand \%, organic carbon \%, gravimetric water content at - 33 kPa and air dry. The results clearly indicated the superiority of equal-area quadratric splines in predicting depth functions. Such splines depend on a parameter, λ that controls goodness-of-fit vs. roughness. Their quality of fit varied with the A value used and it was found that a γ value of 0.1 was the best overall predictor of the depth functions. The results also showed that using additional samples from the top and/or bottom of the soil profiles improved the prediction quality of the spline functions.},

  abstract = {The quantification of organic (OC) and inorganic carbon (IC) in soils provides an essential tool for understanding biogeochemical processes. Examples of its potential application are the assessment of the humification degree of soil organic matter, the calculation of carbon fluxes and budgets in terrestrial systems on a regional and global scale and the investigation of the carbon storage potential of soils. The verification of changes in carbon stocks requires an extensive number of samples as well as precise and reliable analyses. Due to the wide variation in the concentrations of the two forms of carbon in solid samples, the exact distinction is very difficult. We present the advantages of a single-run dual temperature combustion method (SRDTC) at 515 ??C for OC and 925 ??C for IC, which allows the determination of OC, IC and total carbon (TC) within one single analytical run. The three parameters are analyzed in less than 30 min. Additionally, the method is characterized by a significantly reduced variability and low operator bias, as there is no need of chemical sample pre-treatment. It is applicable to a broad range of varying OC and IC contents, which is demonstrated by the use of numerous synthetic soil mixtures that have been analyzed. Furthermore, SRDTC indicates the presence of thermally instable carbonates, like magnesite, in the sample. Use of silver boats as a catalytic agent results in an improved distinction between OC and IC in this case. To examine the accuracy and reliability of the SRDTC method, it was compared to other techniques frequently used for carbon determination in soil samples: total combustion by elemental analysis to determine TC and acidification of the sample prior to combustion to determine OC. We will show that the rugged SRDTC method offers a substantial progress for both the reliable and rapid OC and IC determination in soil samples where elemental carbon is negligible. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {We propose and successfully applied a new approach for 3-source-partitioning based on a combination of 14C labeling with 13C natural abundance. By adding 14C-labeled glucose to soil after C3 - C4 vegetation change, we partitioned three C sources in three compartments, namely CO2, microbial biomass and dissolved organic C (DOC). This enabled us to estimate mechanisms and sources of priming effects (PE).Glucose application at low and high rate (GL: 100 and GH: 1000 ??g C g-1, respectively) caused positive PE both short-term (during 1-3 days) and long-term (3-55 days). Despite a 10-fold difference in the amount of substrate added, the PE observed was larger by a factor of only 1.6 at the high versus low rate of glucose. The real and apparent priming effects were distinguished by partitioning of microbial C for glucose-C and SOM-derived C. As the amount of primed CO2 respired during short-term PE was 40\% lower than microbial C, and the contribution of soil C in microbial biomass did not increase, we concluded that such short-term PE was apparent and was mainly caused by accelerated microbial turnover (at GL) and by pool substitution (at GH). Both the amount of primed CO2-C, which was 1.3-2.1 times larger than microbial C, and the increased contribution of soil C in microbial biomass allowed us to consider the long-term PE as being real. The sole source of real PE (GL treatment) was the "recent" soil organic matter, which is younger than 12-year-old C. The real PE-induced by a glucose amount exceeding microbial biomass (GH) was due to the almost equal contribution of 'recent' ({$<$}12 years) and 'old' ({$>$}12 years) C. Thus, the decomposition of old recalcitrant SOM was induced only by an amount of primer exceeding microbial C. We conclude that combining 14C labeling with 13C natural abundance helped disentangle three C sources in CO2, microbial biomass and DOC and evaluate mechanisms and sources of PE. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

These two processes were disentangled by simultaneously tracking ??13C in three pools - soil organic matter (SOM), microbial biomass, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) - and in CO2 efflux during incubation of 1) soil after C3-C4 vegetation change, and 2) the reference C3 soil.The study was done on the Ap horizon of a loamy Gleyic Cambisol developed under C3 vegetation. Miscanthus giganteus - a perennial C4 plant - was grown for 12 years, and the ??13C signature was used to distinguish between 'old' SOM ({$>$}12 years) and 'recent' Miscanthus-derived C ({$<$}12 years). The differences in ??13C signature of the three C pools and of CO2 in the reference C3 soil were less than 1???, and only ??13C of microbial biomass was significantly different compared to other pools. Nontheless, the neglecting of isotopic fractionation can cause up to 10\% of errors in calculations. In contrast to the reference soil, the ??13C of all pools in the soil after C3-C4 vegetation change was significantly different. Old C contributed only 20\% to the microbial biomass but 60\% to CO2. This indicates that most of the old C was decomposed by microorganisms catabolically, without being utilized for growth. Based on ??13C changes in DOC, CO2 and microbial biomass during 54 days of incubation in Miscanthus and reference soils, we concluded that the main process contributing to changes of the ??13C signature in soil pools was preferential utilization of recent versus old C (causing an up to 9.1??? shift in ??13C values) and not 13C fractionation per se.Based on the ??13C changes in SOM, we showed that the estimated turnover time of old SOM increased by two years per year in 9 years after the vegetation change. The relative increase in the turnover rate of recent microbial C was 3 times faster than that of old C indicating preferential utilization of available recent C versus the old C.Combining long-term field observations with soil incubation reveals that the turnover time of C in microbial biomass was 200 times faster than in total SOM. Our study clearly showed that estimating the residence time of easily degradable microbial compounds and biomarkers should be done at time scales reflecting microbial turnover times (days) and not those of bulk SOM turnover (years and decades). This is necessary because the absence of C reutilization is a prerequisite for correct estimation of SOM turnover. We conclude that comparing the ??13C signature of linked pools helps calculate the relative turnover of old and recent pools. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

BACKGROUND: One aim of education in the health sciences is to enable learners to develop professional competence. Students have a range of learning styles and innovative teaching strategies assist in creating a dynamic learning environment. New attitudes towards experiential learning methods have contributed to the expansion of gaming as a strategy. DATA SOURCES: A search for studies published between January 1980 and June 2008 was undertaken, using appropriate search terms. The databases searched were: British Education Index, British Nursing Index, The Cochrane Library, CINAHLPlus, Medline, PubMed, ERIC, PsychInfo and Australian Education Index. METHODS: All publications and theses identified through the search were assessed for relevance. Sixteen papers reporting empirical studies or reviews that involved comparison of gaming with didactic methods were included. RESULTS: The limited research available indicates that, while both traditional didactic methods and gaming have been successful in increasing student knowledge, neither method is clearly more helpful to students. The use of games generally enhances student enjoyment and may improve long-term retention of information. CONCLUSION: While the use of games can be viewed as a viable teaching strategy, care should be exercised in the use of specific games that have not been assessed objectively. Further research on the use of gaming is needed to enable educators to gaming techniques appropriately for the benefit of students and, ultimately, patients.},

  abstract = {Processes controlling microbial access to soil organic matter are critical for soil nutrient cycling and C stabilization. The bioavailability of soil organic matter partly depends on the rate that substrates become water-soluble, which is determined by some combination of biological, biochemical, and purely abiotic processes. Our goal was to unravel these biotic and abiotic processes to better understand mechanisms controlling the dynamics of bioavailable soil organic carbon (SOC). We sampled soils in a California annual grassland from manipulated plots with and without plants to help distinguish bioavailable SOC generated from mineral-associated organic matter versus from plant detritus (i.e., the “light fraction”). In the laboratory, soils were incubated for 8 months under all possible combinations of three levels of moisture and two levels of microbial biomass using continuous chloroform sterilization. We measured cumulative carbon dioxide (CO2) production and the net change in soil water-extractable organic C (WEOC) to quantify C that was accessed biologically or biochemically. Under the driest conditions, microbes appeared to primarily access WEOC from recent plant C, with the other half of CO2 production explained by extracellular processes. These results suggest that dry, uncolonized conditions promote the adsorption of WEOC onto mineral surfaces. Under wetter conditions, microbial access increased by two orders of magnitude, with a large concomitant decrease in WEOC, particularly in soils without plant inputs from the previous growing season. The largest increase in WEOC occurred in wet sterilized soil, perhaps because exoenzymes and desorption continued solubilizing C but without microbial consumption. A similar amount of WEOC accumulated in wet sterilized soil whether plants were present or not, suggesting that desorption of mineral-associated C was the abiotic WEOC source. Based on these results, we hypothesize that dry-live and wet-uncolonized soil microsites are sources of bioavailable SOC, whereas wet-live and dry-uncolonized microsites are sinks.},

  abstract = {Modern soil taxonomic systems, including Soil Taxonomy (ST) and the World Reference Base (WRB) for Soil Resources, classify soils using diagnostic horizons, properties, and materials. Although these systems are based on genetic principles, the approaches used have de-emphasized the role of soil processes in soil taxonomic systems. Meanwhile, a consideration of soil processes is important for understanding the genetic underpinnings of modern soil taxonomic systems and developing quantitative models of pedogenic systems. Seventeen generalized soil-forming processes are identified, briefly discussed, and linked to soil taxa and diagnostic horizons, properties, and materials in ST and the WRB. The processes are illustrated in simple diagrams and include: (1) argilluviation, (2) biological enrichment of base cations, (3) andisolization, (4) paludization, (5) gleization, (6) melanization, (7) ferrallitization, (8) podzolization, (9) base cation leaching, (10) vertization, (11) cryoturbation, (12) salinization, (13) calcification, (14), solonization, (15) solodization, (16) silicification, and (17) anthrosolization. The implications of soil-forming processes on present and future soil classification systems and pedogenic models are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {Large amounts of low molecular weight (LMW;{$<$}250 Da) carbon (C) are lost from roots into the rhizosphere as a consequence of root turnover and exudation. Their rates of turnover after release into the soil remain poorly understood. We extracted soil solution from a temperate grassland Eutric Cambisol, isotopically labeled the glucose and amino acid components, and then re-injected the solution back into the soil. We followed the subsequent evolution of 14CO2 and incorporation of the LMW C into the soil microbial biomass or grasses for 48 h. The experiments were performed both on grazed and un-grazed swards in the field, and in the laboratory. In the field, we showed that glucose and amino acids had short half-lives (t1/2) in soil solution (t1/2=20-40 min), but that they persisted in soil microbes for much longer. A first-order double exponential model fitted the experimental data well and gave rate constant (k) values of 1.21-2.14 h-1 for k1 and 0.0025-0.0048 h-1 for k2. Only small amounts of the added 14C were recovered in plant biomass ({$<$}5\% of total added to soil) indicating that plant roots are poor competitors for LMW dissolved organic C (DOC) in comparison to soil microorganisms. The first phase of glucose and amino acid mineralization in the laboratory was slower (t1/2=40-60 min) than measured in the field reinforcing the importance of making flux measurements in situ. Whilst grazing stimulated below-ground respiration, it exerted only a small influence on the turnover of LMW DOC suggesting that the increase in respiration was due to increased root respiration and not turnover of soil organic matter (SOM). Our results suggest that some components of the LMW DOC pool are turned over extremely rapidly (ca. 4000 times annually). ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of the meta-cognitive strategies on the academic and gaming achievements. Exploring the effects of those achievements on the social problem solving of students is also of interest. For this purpose, the MMORPG Gersang was used. The participants, consisting of ninth graders, played the game until they all reached the third level to ensure that they have the same gaming ability prior to gaming for the study. Three meta-cognitive strategies were developed: self-recording, modeling and thinking aloud. Those strategies are specially related to gaming activities and applied in pre-gaming activities, gaming activities, and post-gaming activities. Three meta-cognitive strategies were set as independent variables. The social problem solving ability was set as a mediating variable, and academic achievement and scores in the game were chosen as dependent variables. The path between meta-cognitive strategies and both academic achievement and game performance by mediating social problem solving abilities were discovered. The social problem solving ability, which is the mediating variable, affects the academic achievement and the game performance very strongly. These results imply that a commercial game playing in conjunction with meta-cognitive strategies can be an effective way to increase students' performance both in learning and gaming by keeping them involved. Talking and observation activities such as thinking aloud and modeling are more effective than writing activities in enhancing the students' achievements both in learning and gaming.},

Soil organic matter (SOM) represents one of the largest pools of C and mineralization rates are known to be temperature dependent. In this study, we investigated whether different OM fractions present in a forest soil (F/A1 horizon) would respond in a similar manner to elevated temperatures. We examined the trends in isotopic content ( 12 C, 13 C, and 14 C) of soil respired CO 2 at various temperatures (10, 20, and 35°C) over a two year period in the laboratory. We also examined the total C, total N, and C : N ratio in the remaining soil and isolated humic fractions, and the distribution of the individual amino acids in the soil after 5 years of laboratory incubation at the various temperatures. We found that the rate at which C mineralization increases with temperature was occasionally greater than predicted by most models, more C from recalcitrant OM pools being mineralized at the higher temperature. This confirmed that the relationship between soil organic matter decomposition and temperature was complex and that the different pools of organic matter did respond in differing ways to elevated temperatures.},

  abstract = {The current interest in characterizing, predicting and managing soil C dynamics has focused attention on making estimates of C inputs to soil more accurate and precise. Net primary productivity (NPP) provides the inputs of carbon (C) in ecosystems and determines the amount of photosynthetically fixed C that can potentially be sequestered in soil organic matter. We present a method for estimating NPP and annual C inputs to soil for some common Canadian agroecosystems, using a series of plant C allocation coefficients for each crop type across the country. The root-derived C in these coefficients was estimated by reviewing studies reporting information on plant shoot-to-root (S:R) ratios (n = 168). Mean S:R ratios for annual crops were highest for small-grain cereals (7.4), followed by corn (5.6) and soybeans (5.2), and lowest for forages (1.6). The review also showed considerable uncertainty (coefficient of variation for S:R ratios of ∼50\% for annual crops and ∼75\% for perennial forages) in estimating below-ground NPP (BNPP) in agroecosystems; uncertainty was similar to that for Canadian boreal forests. The BNPP (including extra-root C) was lower for annual crops (∼20\% of NPP) than for perennial forages (∼50\%). The latter was similar to estimates for relative below-ground C allocation in other Canadian natural ecosystems such as mixed grasslands and forests. The proposed method is easy to use, specific for particular crops, management practices, and driven by agronomic yields. It can be readily up-dated with new experimental results and measurements of parameters used to quantify the accumulation and distribution of photosynthetically fixed C in different types of crops. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Soil surface CO 2 flux (R S ) is overwhelmingly the product of respiration by roots (autotrophic respiration, R A ) and soil organisms (heterotrophic respiration, R H ). Many studies have attempted to partition R S into these two components, with highly variable results. This study analyzes published data encompassing 54 forest sites and shows that R A and R H are each strongly (R 2 {$>$} 0.8) correlated to annual R S across a wide range of forest ecosystems. Monte Carlo simulation showed that these correlations were significantly stronger than any correlation introduced as an artefact of measurement method. Biome type, measurement method, mean annual temperature, soil drainage, and leaf habit were not significant. For sites with available data, there was a significant (R 2 = 0.56) correlation between total detritus input and R H , while R A was unrelated to net primary production. We discuss why R A and R H might be related to each other on large scales, as both ultimately depend on forest carbon balance and photosynthate supply. Limited data suggest that these or similar relationships have broad applicability in other ecosystem types. Site-specific measurements are always more desirable than the application of inferred broad relationships, but belowground measurements are difficult and expensive, while measuring R S is straightforward and commonly done. Thus the relationships presented here provide a useful method that can help constrain estimates of terrestrial carbon budgets. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Here we introduce the SRDB database, a near-universal compendium of published R-S data, and make it available to the scientific community both as a traditional static archive and as a dynamic community database that may be updated over time by interested users. The database encompasses all published studies that report one of the following data measured in the field (not laboratory): annual R-S, mean seasonal R-S, a seasonal or annual partitioning of R-S into its sources fluxes, R-S temperature response (Q(10)), or R-S at 10 A degrees C. Its orientation is thus to seasonal and annual fluxes, not shorter-term or chamber-specific measurements. To date, data from 818 studies have been entered into the database, constituting 3379 records. The data span the measurement years 1961-2007 and are dominated by temperate, well-drained forests. We briefly examine some aspects of the SRDB data - its climate space coverage, mean annual R-S fluxes and their correlation with other carbon fluxes, R-S variability, temperature sensitivities, and the partitioning of R-S source flux - and suggest some potential lines of research that could be explored using these data. The SRDB database is available online in a permanent archive as well as via a project-hosting repository; the latter source leverages open-source software technologies to encourage wider participation in the database's future development. Ultimately, we hope that the updating of, and corrections to, the SRDB will become a shared project, managed by the users of these data in the scientific community.},

The global soil-to-atmosphere (or total soil respiration, RS) carbon dioxide (CO2) flux is increasing, but the degree to which climate change will stimulate carbon losses from soils as a result of heterotrophic respiration (RH) remains highly uncertain. Here we use an updated global soil respiration database9 to show that the observed soil surface RH:RS ratio increased significantly, from 0.54 to 0.63, between 1990 and 2014 (P = 0.009). Three additional lines of evidence provide support for this finding. By analysing two separate global gross primary production datasets, we find that the ratios of both RH and RS to gross primary production have increased over time. Similarly, significant increases in RH are observed against the longest available solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence global dataset, as well as gross primary production computed by an ensemble of global land models. We also show that the ratio of night-time net ecosystem exchange to gross primary production is rising across the FLUXNET2015 dataset. All trends are robust to sampling variability in ecosystem type, disturbance, methodology, CO2 fertilization effects and mean climate. Taken together, our findings provide observational evidence that global RH is rising, probably in response to environmental changes, consistent with meta-analyses and long-term experiments. This suggests that climate-driven losses of soil carbon are currently occurring across many ecosystems, with a detectable and sustained trend emerging at the global scale.},

The long-term treatments at the Wisconsin plots include no-litter, 2 x litter, and one-time removal of the A horizon. In the first study, LF mass under the no-litter treatment was 64 and 32\% lower for the Noe and Wingra sites, respectively, relative to the controls (unaltered litter inputs); LF mass under the 2 x litter treatment was 85\% higher at Noe, but 15\% lower at the Wingra site. The LF represented only 6.7 and 4.3\% of the total mineral-soil C losses under no-litter and 7.0\% (Noe alone) of the total mineral-soil C gain under 2 x litter. The results suggest that aboveground foliar litter contributed one-third (Wingra) to two-thirds (Noe) of the LF pool. Additionally, the heavy fraction (HF) declined quickly in response to relatively short-term changes in litter input and functioned as the primary long-term C sink. In the second study, LF represented I I \% (corn), 13\% (pine), and 2\% (maple) of the N mineralization potential (anaerobic incubation) for the whole mineral soil; contribution of LF to net N mineralization could not be determined for the cornfield, but was calculated to be 3 kg N ha-' yr-' for both the pine and maple stands. N mineralization potential for the pine and maple sites was consistently lower for LF OM than for HF OM. Both LF mass (corn and pine) and LF N mineralization potential (all sites) showed differences by sampling month. LF constituted 5\% (maple), 13\% (corn), and 14\% (pine) of mineral soil OM. Findings suggest that HF is the primary N source in coarse-textured mineral soils, and also that LF is a relatively minor N source in forest stands with mor-type soil.},

  abstract = {Soil moisture affects microbial decay of SOM and rhizosphere respiration (RR) in temperate forest soils, but isolating the response of soil respiration (SR) to summer drought and subsequent wetting is difficult because moisture changes are often confounded with temperature variation. We distinguished between temperature and moisture effects by simulation of prolonged soil droughts in a mixed deciduous forest at the Harvard Forest, Massachusetts. Roofs constructed over triplicate 5×5m 2 plots excluded throughfall water during the summers of 2001 (168mm) and 2002 (344 mm), while adjacent control plots received ambient throughfall and the same natural temperature regime. In 2003, throughfall was not excluded to assess the response of SR under natural weather conditions after two prolonged summer droughts. Throughfall exclusion significantly decreased mean SR rate by 53mgCm -2 h -1 over 84 days in 2001, and by 68mgCm -2 h -1 over 126 days in 2002, representing 10-30\% of annual SR in this forest and 35-75\% of annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of C. The differences in SR were best explained by differences in gravimetric water content in the Oi horizon (r250.69) and the Oe/Oa horizon (r250.60). Volumetric water content of the A horizon was not significantly affected by throughfall exclusion. The radiocarbon signature of soil CO 2 efflux and of CO 2 respired during incubations of O horizon, A horizon and living roots allowed partitioning of SR into contributions from young C substrate (including RR) and from decomposition of older SOM. RR (root respiration and microbial respiration of young substrates in the rhizosphere) made up 43-71\% of the total C respired in the control plots and 41-80\% in the exclusion plots, and tended to increase with drought. An exception to this trend was an interesting increase in CO 2 efflux of radiocarbon-rich substrates during a period of abundant growth of mushrooms. Our results suggest that prolonged summer droughts decrease primarily heterotrophic respiration in the O horizon, which could cause increases in the storage of soil organic carbon in this forest. However, the C stored during two summers of simulated drought was only partly released as increased respiration during the following summer of natural throughfall. We do not know if this soil C sink during drought is transient or long lasting. In any case, differential decomposition of the O horizon caused by interannual variation of precipitation probably contributes significantly to observed interannual variation of NEE in temperate forests. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {In the next decades, many soils will be subjected to increased drying/ wetting cycles or modified water availability considering predicted global changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration. These changes may affect the turnover of C and N in soils, but the direction of changes is still unclear. The aim of the review is the evaluation of involved mechanisms, the intensity, duration and frequency of drying and wetting for the mineralization and fluxes of C and N in terrestrial soils. Controversial study results require a reappraisal of the present understanding that wetting of dry soils induces significant losses of soil C and N. The generally observed pulse in net C and N mineralization following wetting of dry soil (hereafter wetting pulse) is short-lived and often exceeds the mineralization rate of a respective moist control. Accumulated microbial and plant necromass, lysis of live microbial cells, release of compatible solutes and exposure of previously protected organic matter may explain the additional mineralization during wetting of soils. Frequent drying and wetting diminishes the wetting pulse due to limitation of the accessible organic matter pool. Despite wetting pulses, cumulative C and N mineralization (defined here as total net mineralization during drying and wetting) are mostly smaller compared with soil with optimum moisture, indicating that wetting pulses cannot compensate for small mineralization rates during drought periods. Cumulative mineralization is linked to the intensity and duration of drying, the amount and distribution of precipitation, temperature, hydrophobicity and the accessible pool of organic substrates. Wetting pulses may have a significant impact on C and N mineralization or flux rates in arid and semiarid regions but have less impact in humid and subhumid regions on annual time scales. Organic matter stocks are progressively preserved with increasing duration and intensity of drought periods; however, fires enhance the risk of organic matter losses under dry conditions. Hydrophobicity of organic surfaces is an important mechanism that reduces C and N mineralization in topsoils after precipitation. Hence, mineralization in forest soils with hydrophobic organic horizons is presumably stronger limited than in grassland or farmland soils. Even in humid regions, suboptimal water potentials often restrict microbial activity in topsoils during growing seasons. Increasing summer droughts will likely reduce the mineralization and fluxes of C and N whereas increasing summer precipitation could enhance the losses of C and N from soils. © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing.},

  abstract = {Soil organic matter quality in the sense of how easily carbon in the soil organic matter can be mineralised is a major determinant of soil carbon storage and rate of mineralisation of nutrients. Its origin has so far remained elusive and a number of indices, such as C-to-N-ratio, lignin concentration and other combinations of chemical constituents have been used as substitutes for quality. We suggest here that quality is the number of enzymatic steps required to release as carbon dioxide a carbon atom from an organic compound. The larger the number of steps the lower is the quality of the carbon atom. Such a measure connects quality to thermodynamics. It also explains the rapid decrease in decomposition rate with decreasing quality suggested in the q-theory of organic matter dynamics and shows that the decomposition rate of low quality substrates has a stronger temperature dependence than that of high quality substrates.},

  abstract = {All living systems depend on transformations of elements between different states. In particular, the transformation of dead organic matter in the soil (SOM) by decomposers (microbes) releases elements incorporated in SOM and makes the elements available anew to plants. A major problem in analysing and describing this process is that SOM, as the result of the decomposer activity, is a mixture of a very large number of molecules with widely differing chemical and physical properties. The continuous- quality equation (CQE) is a general equation describing this complexity by assigning a continuous-quality variable to each carbon atom in SOM. The use ofCQE has been impeded by its complicated mathematics. Here, we show by deriving exact solutions that, at least for some specific cases, there exist solutions to CQE. These exact solutions show that previous approximations have overestimated the rate by which litter decomposes and as a consequence underestimated steady state SOM amounts. The exact and approximate solutions also differ with respect to the parameter space in which they yield finite steady-state SOM amounts. The latter point is important because temperature is one of the parameters and climatic change may move the solution from a region of the parameter space with infinite steady-state SOM to a region of finite steady-state SOM, with potentially large changes in soil carbon stores. We also show that the solution satisfies the Chapman–Kolmogorov theorem. The importance of this is that it provides efficient algorithms for numerical solutions.},

Building soil carbon is an appealing way to increase carbon sinks and reduce emissions owing to the associated benefits to agriculture. However, the practical implementation of soil carbon climate strategies lags behind the potential, partly because we lack clarity around the magnitude of opportunity and how to capitalize on it. Here we quantify the role of soil carbon in natural (land-based) climate solutions and review some of the project design mechanisms available to tap into the potential. We show that soil carbon represents 25\% of the potential of natural climate solutions (total potential, 23.8 Gt of CO2-equivalent per year), of which 40\% is protection of existing soil carbon and 60\% is rebuilding depleted stocks. Soil carbon comprises 9\% of the mitigation potential of forests, 72\% for wetlands and 47\% for agriculture and grasslands. Soil carbon is important to land-based efforts to prevent carbon emissions, remove atmospheric carbon dioxide and deliver ecosystem services in addition to climate mitigation.},

  abstract = {The mechanisms behind the 13C enrichment of organic matter with increasing soil depth in forests are unclear. To determine if 13C discrimination during respiration could contribute to this pattern, we compared δ13C signatures of respired CO2 from sieved mineral soil, litter layer and litterfall with measurements of δ13C and δ15N of mineral soil, litter layer, litterfall, roots and fungal mycelia sampled from a 68-year-old Norway spruce forest stand planted on previously cultivated land. Because the land was subjected to ploughing before establishment of the forest stand, shifts in δ13C in the top 20 cm reflect processes that have been active since the beginning of the reforestation process. As 13C-depleted organic matter accumulated in the upper soil, a 1.0‰ δ13C gradient from -28.5‰ in the litter layer to -27.6‰ at a depth of 2-6 cm was formed. This can be explained by the 1‰ drop in δ13C of atmospheric CO2 since the beginning of reforestation together with the mixing of new C (forest) and old C (farmland). However, the isotopic change of the atmospheric CO2 explains only a portion of the additional 1.0‰ increase in δ13C below a depth of 20 cm. The δ13C of the respired CO2 was similar to that of the organic matter in the upper soil layers but became increasingly 13C enriched with depth, up to 2.5‰ relative to the organic matter. We hypothesise that this 13C enrichment of the CO2 as well as the residual increase in δ13C of the organic matter below a soil depth of 20 cm results from the increased contribution of 13C-enriched microbially derived C with depth. Our results suggest that 13C discrimination during microbial respiration does not contribute to the 13C enrichment of organic matter in soils. We therefore recommend that these results should be taken into consideration when natural variations in δ13C of respired CO2 are used to separate different components of soil respiration or ecosystem respiration. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

Much is known about the processes that regulate the carbon isotopic composition (δ13C) of leaf, plant, and ecosystem carbon pools and of photosynthetic and respiratory carbon dioxide (CO 2) fluxes. In this review, systematic patterns and mechanisms underlying variation in δ13C of plant and ecosystem carbon pools and fluxes are described. We examine the hypothesis that the δ13C of leaf biomass can be used as a reference point for other carbon pools and fluxes, which differ from the leaf in δ13C in a systematic fashion. Plant organs are typically enriched in 13C relative to leaves, and most ecosystem pools and respiratory fluxes are enriched relative to sun leaves of dominant plants, with the notable exception of root respiration. Analysis of the chemical and isotopic composition of leaves and leaf respiration suggests that growth respiration has the potential to contribute substantially to the observed offset between the δ 13C values of ecosystem respiration and the bulk leaf. We discuss the implications of systematic variations in δ13C of ecosystem pools and CO2 fluxes for studies of carbon cycling within ecosystems, as well as for studies that use the δ13C of atmospheric CO2 to diagnose changes in the terrestrial biosphere over annual to millennial time scales. © The Authors (2008).},

  abstract = {Quantifying where, when, and how much denitrification occurs on the basis of measurements alone remains particularly vexing at virtually all spatial scales. As a result, models have become essential tools for integrating current understanding of the processes that control denitrification with measurements of rate-controlling properties so that the permanent losses of N within landscapes can be quantified at watershed and regional scales. In this paper, we describe commonly used approaches for modeling denitrification and N cycling processes in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems based on selected examples from the literature. We highlight future needs for developing complementary measurements and models of denitrification. Most of the approaches described here do not explicitly simulate microbial dynamics, but make predictions by representing the environmental conditions where denitrification is expected to occur, based on conceptualizations of the N cycle and empirical data from field and laboratory investigations of the dominant process controls. Models of denitrification in terrestrial ecosystems include generally similar rate-controlling variables, but vary in their complexity of the descriptions of natural and human-related properties of the landscape, reflecting a range of scientific and management perspectives. Models of denitrification in aquatic ecosystems range in complexity from highly detailed mechanistic simulations of the N cycle to simpler source-transport models of aggregate N removal processes estimated with empirical functions, though all estimate aquatic N removal using first-order reaction rate or mass-transfer rate expressions. Both the terrestrial and aquatic modeling approaches considered here generally indicate that denitrification is an important and highly substantial component of the N cycle over large spatial scales. However, the uncertainties of model predictions are large. Future progress will be linked to advances in field measurements, spatial databases, and model structures.},

  abstract = {Most current soil organic matter (SOM) models represent the soil as a bulk without specification of the vertical distribution of SOM in the soil profile. However, the vertical SOM profile may be of great importance for soil carbon cycling, both on short (hours to years) time scale, due to interactions with the soil temperature and moisture profile, as well as on long (years to centuries) time scale because of depth-specific stabilization mechanisms of organic matter. It is likely that a representation of the SOM profile and surface organic layers in SOM models can improve predictions of the response of land surface fluxes to climate and environmental variability. Although models capable of simulating the vertical SOM profile exist, these were generally not developed for large scale predictive simulations and do not adequately represent surface organic horizons. We present SOMPROF, a vertically explicit SOM model, designed for implementation into large scale ecosystem and land surface models. The model dynamically simulates the vertical SOM profile and organic layer stocks based on mechanistic representations of bioturbation, liquid phase transport of organic matter, and vertical distribution of root litter input. We tested the model based on data from an old growth deciduous forest (Hainich) in Germany, and performed a sensitivity analysis of the transport parameters, and the effects of the vertical SOM distribution on temporal variation of heterotrophic respiration. Model results compare well with measured organic carbon profiles and stocks. SOMPROF is able to simulate a wide range of SOM profiles, using parameter values that are realistic compared to those found in previous studies. Results of the sensitivity analysis show that the vertical SOM distribution strongly affects temporal variation of heterotrophic respiration due to interactions with the soil temperature and moisture profile. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Eleven parameters, defining decomposition and transport in the soil carbon model SOMPROF, were estimated using a Bayesian approach based on organic carbon measurements and radiocarbon concentration of SOM and heterotrophic respiration. The addition of radiocarbon data had strong effects on the parameters, most importantly a reduction of the decomposition and production rate of the slowest SOM pool by an order of magnitude, and a similar reduction in advective SOM transport. The modified parameters further led to changes in the partitioning of SOM over the different model pools. The calibration results were subsequently used to perform transient soil carbon projections for the period 1901–2100. These simulations were run with parameter sets from calibrations both with and without radiocarbon. The results show an increase over time of topsoil carbon and a decrease in the subsoil, adding to a net gain overall. Near the end of the 21st century, total carbon stocks stabilize and—for the radiocarbon-constrained model—start to decrease. However, the changes are small compared to the total stocks. The model results for the calibrations with and without radiocarbon are in general quite similar, but the latter shows notably higher heterotrophic respiration fluxes. Constraining the model with radiocarbon yielded only a small reduction of uncertainty for the total carbon stocks, while for the individual depth compartments, the uncertainty was increased.},

While lab-based VisNIR has been established as a viable technique for estimating various soil properties, few experiments have compared the predictive accuracy of on-the-go and lab-based VisNIR. In this study, eight north central Montana wheat fields were intensively interrogated using on-the-go and lab-based VisNIR. The on-the-go VisNIR system employed a spectrophotometer (350-2224 nm, 8-nm spectral resolution) built into an agricultural shank mounted on a toolbar and pulled behind a tractor. Regional (whole-field out cross-validation) and hybrid (regional model including randomly chosen "local" calibration samples) spectral models were calibrated using partial least squares regression. Lab-based spectral data consistently provided more accurate predictions than on-the-go data. However, neither in situ nor lab-based spectroscopy yielded even semi-quantitative SOC predictions. For hybrid models with nine local samples included in the calibrations, standard error of prediction (SEP) values were 2.6 and 3.4 g kg-1 for lab and on-the-go VisNIR respectively, with ??SOC = 3.2 g kg-1. With an SOC coefficient of variation (CV) = 26.7\%, even with a relatively low SEP values, there was little SOC variability to explain. For clay content, hybrid-7 calibrations yielded lab SEP = 53.1 g kg-1 and residual product differential (RPD) = 1.8 with on-the-go SEP = 69.4 g kg-1 and RPD = 1.4. With more variability (??clay = 91.4 g kg-1 and CV = 49.6\%), both lab and on-the-go VisNIR show better explanatory power. There a number of potential explanations for degraded on-the-go predictive accuracy: soil heterogeneity, field moisture, consistent sample presentation, and a difference between the spatial support of on-the-go measurements and soil samples collected for laboratory analyses. In terms of predictive accuracy, our results are largely consistent with those previously published by Christy (2008), but on-the-go VisNIR was not able to capture the subtle SOC variability in Montana soils. Though the current configuration of the Veris on-the-go VisNIR system allows for rapid field scanning, on-the-go soil processing (i.e. drying, crushing, and sieving) could improve predictions. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is a key nutrient but still we have a limited knowledge on the controls of mobilization and fluxes of P in forest soils. Our study explored the linkages between P mobilization in organic horizons and mineral soils and the P status of soils, as affected by two consecutive drying and rewetting (D/W) cycles. We sampled litter layers (Oi), mixed Oe-Oa horizons, and A horizons in three beech forests along a P availability gradient in Germany. Carbon mineralization and release of dissolved organic matter (DOC, DOP) and dissolved inorganic P (DIP) were studied in microcosms exposed to an initial harsh drying (40 °C for 72 h) and a moderate dry spell (1 month at 20 °C). In Oi horizons, net P mineralization decreased with decreasing P status despite a similar C mineralization at all sites. This supports the general concept that the stoichiometric difference between substrate and microbial biomass primarily drives P release from decomposing organic matter. Counterintuitively, P mobilization per unit soil P increased towards P-poor sites in the mineral soil, likely due to decreasing contents of reactive secondary minerals and the consequently smaller P sorption. Drying and rewetting caused stronger mobilization of DIP and DOP (+108\% on average) than of DOC (+51\%). The parallel decline in specific UV absorptivity of DOM suggests that lysis of microbial cells drove the drought-induced P release. The D/W effects on P mobilization were particularly strong in P-poor soils, where greater portions of P are bound to microbial biomass, which are prone to become released upon rewetting. Since mobilized P can potentially be leached from soils, our findings indicate, that drought-induced P mobilization fosters the progressive P depletion of already P-poor soils. The possible P leaching losses from mineral soils seem rather be driven by soil mineralogy than by P status.},

  abstract = {A theory called the Regulatory Gate Hypothesis was previously proposed to considers that the rate limiting step in soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralization is independent of the size, community stricture or specific activity (mg CO2-C evolved g−1biomass C) of the soil microbial biomass. Here we report new experiments to test this hypothesis. In the first experiment, six different soils were perfused with CHCl3-saturated water to model SOC release and to stop microbial activity. Apart from one highly organic soil, they all released SOC at low and roughly constant rates, over sixty three days. In the second experiment, when the freeze-dried perfusates were returned to the parent soils, their \% mineralization ranged from 17 to 35\% over ten days, in contrast to bulk SOC (range 0.46–0.77\%). In the third experiment, two soils were given three consecutive fumigations, each followed by 10 days aerobic incubation. The microbial biomass was decreased by {$>$} 90\%, yet SOC mineralization proceeded at the same rate as in nonfumigated soil. In the fourth experiment, the six soils were subjected to various perturbations, including non-perturbed controls, fumigation-incubation, air-drying rewetting, freeze-thaw (−20 °C and −80 °C) and sieving {$<$} 0.3 mm. After an initial flush due to the perturbations, the rates of mineralization became roughly equal in nearly all soil treatments and comparable to the control, despite significant declines in biomass. This shows that basal respiration was little affected by the perturbations. In Experiment five the effects of the perturbations on the microbial communities in the different soils and perturbations were determined. The bacterial community was significantly modified by both fumigation and air drying-rewetting, due mainly to increased Firmiculites and decreased Proteobacteria populations. Our findings suggest that mineralization of SOC is a two-stage process: firstly, non-bioavailable forms are converted abiologically to bioavailable forms (termed the Regulatory Gate), which, only then, undergo second process, biological mineralization. This finding has serious implications for theories of e.g. SOC dynamics, effects of global warming and soil nutrient cycling.},

  abstract = {Global maize production alters an enormous soil organic C (SOC) stock, ultimately affecting greenhouse gas concentrations and the capacity of agroecosystems to buffer climate variability. Inorganic N fertilizer is perhaps the most important factor affecting SOC within maize-based systems due to its effects on crop residue production and SOC mineralization. Using a continuous maize cropping system with a 13 year N fertilizer gradient (0-269 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) that created a large range in crop residue inputs (3.60-9.94 Mg dry matter ha(-1) yr(-1)), we provide the first agronomic assessment of long-term N fertilizer effects on SOC with direct reference to N rates that are empirically determined to be insufficient, optimum, and excessive. Across the N fertilizer gradient, SOC in physico-chemically protected pools was not affected by N fertilizer rate or residue inputs. However, unprotected particulate organic matter (POM) fractions increased with residue inputs. Although N fertilizer was negatively linearly correlated with POM C/N ratios, the slope of this relationship decreased from the least decomposed POM pools (coarse POM) to the most decomposed POM pools (fine intra-aggregate POM). Moreover, C/N ratios of protected pools did not vary across N rates, suggesting little effect of N fertilizer on soil organic matter (SOM) after decomposition of POM. Comparing a N rate within 4\% of agronomic optimum (208 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and an excessive N rate (269 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), there were no differences between SOC amount, SOM C/N ratios, or microbial biomass and composition. These data suggest that excessive N fertilizer had little effect on SOM and they complement agronomic assessments of environmental N losses, that demonstrate N2 O and NO3 emissions exponentially increase when agronomic optimum N is surpassed.},

At low organic carbon contents, it is difficult to distinguish between organic and inorganic carbon, e.g. carbonates, in soils. The common gas-volumetric method to determine carbonate has a number of disadvantages. We hypothesize that a combination of two spectroscopic methods, which account for different forms of carbonate, can be used to model soil carbonate in our region. Fourier transform mid-infrared spectroscopy was combined with X-ray diffraction to develop a model based on partial least squares regression. Results of the gas-volumetric Scheibler method were corrected for the calcite/dolomite ratio. The best model performance was achieved when we combined the two analytical methods using four principal components. The root mean squared error of prediction decreased from 13.07 to 11.57, while full cross-validation explained 94.5 \% of the variance of the carbonate content. This is the first time that a combination of the proposed methods has been used to predict carbonate in forest soils, offering a simple method to precisely estimate soil carbonate contents while increasing accuracy in comparison with spectroscopic approaches proposed earlier. This approach has the potential to complement or substitute gas-volumetric methods, specifically in study areas with low soil heterogeneity and similar parent material or in long-term monitoring by consecutive sampling.},

In humid regions, topographic wetness indices (TWIs) are widely used to approximate relative soil moisture patterns. However, there are many ways to calculate TWIs and very few field studies have evaluated the different approaches – especially in the US. We calculated TWIs using over 400 unique formulations that considered different digital elevation model (DEM) resolutions (cell size), vertical precision of DEM, flow direction and slope algorithms, smoothing via low-pass filtering, and the inclusion of relevant soil properties. We correlated each TWI with observed patterns of soil moisture at five agricultural fields in central NY, USA, with each field visited five to eight times between August and November 2012. Using a mixed effects modeling approach, we were able to identify optimal TWI formulations applicable to moderate relief agricultural settings that may provide guidance for practitioners and future studies. Overall, TWIs were moderately well correlated with observed soil moisture patterns; in the best case the relationship between TWI and soil moisture had an average \emph{R}\textsuperscript{2} and Spearman correlation value of 0.61 and 0.78, respectively. In all cases, fine-scale (3 m) lidar-derived DEMs worked better than USGS 10 m DEMs and, in general, including soil properties improved correlations.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We present evidence from soil incubations with stable-isotope labeled necromass that abiotic adsorption may be more important than biotic immobilization for short-term necromass retention. We demonstrate that necromass adsorbs not only to mineral surfaces, but may also interact with other necromass. Furthermore, necromass cell chemistry alters necromass-necromass interaction, with more bacterial tracer retained when there is yeast necromass present. These findings suggest that the adsorption and abiotic interaction of microbial necromass and its functional properties, beyond chemical stability, deserve further investigation in the context of soil carbon sequestration.},

In terms of manure P solubility, La:water-extractable P (WEP) ratios close to 1:1 resulted in maximum WEP reduction of 95\% in dairy manure and 98\% in dry poultry litter. Results from the runoff study showed that REE applications to dry manures such as poultry litter were less effective in reducing dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) in runoff than in liquid manures and slurries, which was likely due to mixing limitations. The most effective reductions of DRP in runoff by REEs were observed in the alkaline pH soil, although reductions of DRP in runoff from the acidic soil were still {$>$}50\%. Particulate REEs were strongly associated with particulate P in runoff, suggesting a potentially useful role in tracking the fate of P and other manure constituents from manure-amended soils. Finally, REEs that remained in soil following runoff had a tendency to precipitate WEP, especially in soils receiving manure amendments. The findings have valuable applications in water quality protection and the evaluation of P site assessment indices.},

Over the 39-year period, organic fertilizers at high and low rates (OFH and OFL), mineral fertilizers (MF), and a control site without fertilizers (CK) showed an increase of PC compared to a natural fallow plot (F).

An increase in OC stocks in response to organic fertilization was not limited to the surface soil, but it continued down the soil profile to a depth of 160cm. The maximum potential for neoformation of PC depends on Ca\textsuperscript{2+} and Mg\textsuperscript{2+} availability; in this study these cations were provided by irrigation water. However, organic and mineral fertilizers modify this potential.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}An improved representation of the carbon cycle in permafrost regions will enable more realistic projections of the future climate-carbon system. Currently JULES (the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator) \&ndash; the land surface model of the UK Earth System Model (UKESM) \&ndash; uses the standard 4-pool RothC soil carbon model. This paper describes a new version of JULES (vn4.3\_permafrost) in which the soil vertical dimension is added to the soil carbon model, with a set of four pools in every soil layer. The respiration rate in each soil layer depends on the temperature and moisture conditions in that layer. Cryoturbation/bioturbation processes, which transfer soil carbon between layers, are represented by diffusive mixing. The litter inputs and the soil respiration are both parameterised to decrease with increasing depth. The model now includes a tracer so that selected soil carbon can be labelled and tracked through a simulation. Simulations show an improvement in the large-scale horizontal and vertical distribution of soil carbon over the standard version of JULES (vn4.3). Like the standard version of JULES, the vertically discretised model is still unable to simulate enough soil carbon in the tundra regions. This is in part because JULES underestimates the plant productivity over the tundra, but also because not all of the processes relevant for the accumulation of permafrost carbon are included in the model. In comparison with the standard model, the vertically discretised model shows a delay in the onset of soil respiration in the spring, resulting in an increased net uptake of carbon during this time. In order to provide a more suitable representation of permafrost carbon for quantifying the permafrost carbon feedback within UKESM, the deep soil carbon in the permafrost region (below 1\&thinsp;m) was initialised using the observed soil carbon. There is now a slight drift in the soil carbon ({$<\&$}thinsp;0.018\&thinsp;\%\&thinsp;decade\textsuperscript{\&minus;1}), but the change in simulated soil carbon over the 20\textsuperscript{th} century, when there is little climate change, is comparable to the original vertically discretised model and significantly larger than the drift.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was extracted from the forest soils incubated at a controlled temperature and water content. Soils were sampled from forest plots from Sweden to Italy. The plots represent monocultures of spruce, pine and beech and three selected chronosequences of spruce and beech spanning a range of mean annual temperature from 2 to 14 °C. The DOM was characterized by its DOC/DON ratio and the C isotope composition δ13C. The DOC/DON ratio of DOM varied from 25 to 15 after 16 days of incubation and it decreased to between 16 and 10 after 126 days. At the beginning of incubation the δ13C values of DOC were 1‰ or 2‰ less negative than incubated soils. At the end of the experiment δ13C of DOC were the same as soil values. In addition to DOC production heterotrophic respiration and N mineralization were measured on the incubated soils. The DON production rates decreased from 30 to 5 μgN gC-1 d-1 after 16 days of incubation to constant values from 5 to 2 μgN gC-1 d-1 after 126 days at the end of experiment. The DIN production rates were nearly constant during the experiments with values ranging from 20 to 4 μgN gC-1 d-1. DOC production followed first-order reaction kinetics and heterotrophic respiration followed zero-order reaction kinetics. Kinetic analysis of the experimental data yielded mean annual DOC and respiration productions with respect to sites. Mean annual estimates of DOC flux varied from 3 to 29 g of C m-2 (1-19 mg C g-1 of available C), corresponding to mean DOC concentrations from 2 to 85 mg C L-1. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Our results show that the LF and clay fractions have distinct spectral features regardless of site. The LF is characterized by absorbance at 3400 cm1, as well as between 1750 and 1350 cm1. The clay fraction is distin-guished by absorption near 1230 cm1, and absorption at 780 to 620 cm1. The POM, like the LF, absorbs at the broad peak at 1360 cm1. High SOM soils are characterized by absorbance at 1230 cm1, a band for aromatics, possibly associated with resistant C. Soils from different sampling depths have specific spectral properties. A band at 1330 cm1 is characteristic of shallow depths. Because of their low organic matter (OM) content, the deeper samples are characterized by mineral bands such as quartz, clays, and carbonate. Spectroscopic data indicates that the clay fraction and the LF suffered measurable chemical transformations during the 800-d incubation, but the POM and silt fraction did not. As the LF decomposes, it loses absorbance at 3400, 1223, and 2920 to 2860 cm1. The band at 1630 cm1 increased during incubation, suggesting a resistant form of organic C. The clay fraction suffered changes that were opposite to those of the LF, indicating that LF decomposition and clay decomposition follow different chemistries.}

Permanganate-oxidizable C (POXC) is a widely used method for the study of labile C dynamics in soils. Rapid methods are needed to measure labile C, and better understand how this pool varies with soil C at regional scales. Infrared spectroscopy is an inexpensive way to quantify SOC and observe fluctuations in C functional groups. Using a sample set that encompassed several soil types and plant communities (seven different research projects, n = 496), soils were analyzed via diffuse reflectance Fourier transformed mid-infrared (MidIR, 4000–400 cm–1) and near-infrared (NIR, 10000–4000 cm–1) spectroscopy. Spectral data were used to develop calibrations for POXC, soil organic C (SOC), and total N (TN) using partial least squares (PLS) regression. The MidIR predicted POXC slightly better than the NIR, with calibration and/or validation R2 values ranging from 0.77 to 0.81 depending on spectral pretreatments. Predictions for POXC were better than SOC and TN, but site variability influenced the calibration quality for SOC and TN. Using a selected MidIR region, which included bands correlated to POXC (3225–2270 cm–1), reduced the calibration quality, but still gave acceptable R2 values of 0.76 to 0.77 for the calibration and validation sets. We show that POXC can be predicted using NIR and MidIR spectra. Selecting informative spectral bands offers an alternative to using full spectra for PLS regressions.}

Spatial variability was investigated using semivariograms and the ratio of nugget to total semivariance, expressed as a percentage, was used to classify spatial dependence. A ratio of {$<$}25\% indicated strong spatial dependence, between 25 and 75\% indicated moderate spatial dependence, and {$>$}75\% indicated weak spatial dependence. Twelve parameters at Site one, including organic C, total N, pH, and macroaggregation, and four parameters at Site two, including organic C and total N, were strongly spatially dependent. Six parameters at Site one, including biomass C and N, bulk density, and denitrification, and 9 parameters at Site two, including biomass C and N and bulk density, were moderately spatially dependent. Three parameters at Site one, including NO3- N and ergosterol, and one parameter at Site two, mineral-associated N, were weakly spatially dependent. Distributions of exchangeable Ca and Mg at Site one were not spatially dependent. Spatial distributions for some soil properties were similar for both field sites. We will be able to exploit these similarities to improve our ability to extrapolate information taken from one field to other fields within similar landscapes.},

  abstract = {Many areas in sub-Saharan African are data-poor and poorly accessible. The estimation of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in these areas will have to rely on the limited available secondary data coupled with restricted field sampling. We assessed the total SOC stock, its spatial variation and the causes of this variation in Limpopo National Park (LNP), a data-poor and poorly accessible area in southwestern Mozambique. During a field survey, A-horizon thickness was measured and soil samples were taken for the determination of SOC concentrations. SOC concentrations were multiplied by soil bulk density and A-horizon thickness to estimate SOC stocks. Spatial distribution was assessed through: i) a measure-and-multiply approach to assess average SOC stocks by landscape unit, and ii) a soil-landscape model that used soil forming factors to interpolate SOC stocks from observations to a grid covering the area by ordinary (OK) and universal (UK) kriging. Predictions were validated by both independent and leave-one-out cross validations. The total SOC stock of the LNP was obtained by i) calculating an area-weighted average from the means of the landscape units and by ii) summing the cells of the interpolated grid. Uncertainty was evaluated by the mean standard error for the measure-and-multiply approach and by the mean kriging prediction standard deviation for the soil-landscape model approach. The reliability of the estimates of total stocks was assessed by the uncertainty of the input data and its effect on estimates. The mean SOC stock from all sample points is 1.59kgm-2; landscape unit averages are 1.13-2.46kgm-2. Covariables explained 45\% (soil) and 17\% (coordinates) of SOC stock variation. Predictions from spatial models averaged 1.65kgm-2 and are within the ranges reported for similar soils in southern Africa. The validation root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) was about 30\% of the mean predictions for both OK and UK. Uncertainty is high (coefficient of variation of about 40\%) due to short-range spatial structure combined with sparse sampling. The range of total SOC stock of the 10,410km-2 study area was estimated at 15,579-17,908Gg. However, 90\% confidence limits of the total stocks estimated are narrower (5-15\%) for the measure-and-multiply model and wider (66-70\%) for the soil-landscape model. The spatial distribution is rather homogenous, suggesting levels are mainly determined by regional climate. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The biomass of wood, foliage, and roots was highest in the unthinned control stands, lowest in stands measured 3 years after thinning, and intermediate in the stands measured 16 years following the same prescription. While total wood net primary production (NPP) followed the same pattern as biomass across treatments, an apparent doubling of shrub foliage NPP in the 3 years following overstory thinning reduced the impacts of thinning on total foliage NPP. Similarly, reductions in coarse root NPP associated with tree removal were largely offset by increases in fine root production. Compensatory NPP by shrubs and fine roots increased the light use efficiency of thinned stands 60\% over that of unthinned plots. Both soil respiration and the decomposition of aboveground dead wood appeared conserved across all treatments. Results suggest that when modeling the influence fuel reduction treatments on regional carbon dynamics, it may be necessary to consider the compensatory responses of understory vegetation as such shifts in growth form can effect meaningful changes in the capture and allocation of carbon in the ecosystem. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) is an important natural resource. It is fundamental to soil and ecosystem functions across a wide range of scales, from site-specific soil fertility and water holding capacity to global biogeochemical cycling. It is also a highly complex material that is sensitive to direct and indirect human impacts. In SOM research, simulation models play an important role by providing a mathematical framework to integrate, examine, and test the understanding of SOM dynamics. Simulation models of SOM are also increasingly used in more 'applied' settings to evaluate human impacts on ecosystem function, and to manage SOM for greenhouse gas mitigation, improved soil health, and sustainable use as a natural resource. Within this context, there is a need to maintain a robust connection between scientific developments in SOM modeling approaches and SOM model applications. This need forms the basis of this review. In this review we first provide an overview of SOM modeling, focusing on SOM theory, data-model integration, and model development as evidenced by a quantitative review of SOM literature. Second, we present the landscape of SOM model applications, focusing on examples in climate change policy. We conclude by discussing five areas of recent developments in SOM modeling including: (1) microbial roles in SOM stabilization; (2) modeling SOM saturation kinetics; (3) temperature controls on decomposition; (4) SOM dynamics in deep soil layers; and (5) SOM representation in earth system models. Our aim is to comprehensively connect SOM model development to its applications, revealing knowledge gaps in need of focused interdisciplinary attention and exposing pitfalls that, if avoided, can lead to best use of SOM models to support policy initiatives and sustainable land management solutions.},

This study evaluated a number of remote sensing methods for classifying land cover and land cover change throughout a two-county area in northeastern Oregon (1986 to 2011). In the past three decades, this region has seen significant changes in forest management that have affected land use and land cover. This study employed an accuracy assess- ment-based empirical approach to test the optimality of a number of advanced digital image processing techniques that have recently emerged in the field of remote sensing. The accuracies are assessed using traditional error matrices, calculated using reference data obtained in the field. We found that, for single-time land cover classification, Bayes pixel-based classification using samples created with scale and shape segmentation parameters of 8 and 0.3, respec- tively, resulted in the highest overall accuracy. For land cover change detection, using Landsat-5 TM band 7 with a change threshold of 1.75 standard deviations resulted in the highest accuracy for forest harvesting and regeneration mapping.

  abstract = {The common notion for describing N mineralization in models is that it results from decomposer organisms trying to meet their stoichiometric demands based on their own elemental composition and that of the resource. However, in addition to influencing C and nutrient availability, plant litter also influences the composition of both the litter and mineral soil community - importantly not in the same manner - resulting in altered trophic interactions. Since decomposer groups and their consumers vary in their elemental composition and demands, a change in composition and abundance of soil functional groups may result in a change in the stoichiometry of the whole soil food web, thus altering their stoichiometric relations with the available resource with potential functional consequences. We use experimental data and quantitative food web modeling to investigate the impact of the changes in the litter and soil food webs brought about by the differing stoichiometry of plant litter on (a) N mineralization, (b) the contribution of different functional groups to mineralization, and (c) the stoichiometric flexibility of the system, assessed as the ability to mineralize materials with different stoichiometry. Our simulations suggested that the effects of litter stoichiometry on trophic interactions, their impacts on N mineralization and the relative contribution of functional groups may not behave as a continuum across the litter and soil interface. Further, changes in food webs associated with variation in plant stoichiometric traits can influence the relative importance of functional groups, which given their particular stoichiometric demands may affect ecosystem-level N cycling. Our results suggested that litter materials of intermediate N contents, or litter mixtures encompassing materials with different nutrient contents and thus resulting in mixtures of intermediate stoichiometry, may promote food webs that are better suited to deal with changing substrate stoichiometry.},

  abstract = {The response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to climate change is among the largest uncertainties affecting future climate change projections. The feedback between the terrestrial carbon cycle and climate is partly determined by changes in the turnover time of carbon in land ecosystems, which in turn is an ecosystem property that emerges from the interplay between climate, soil and vegetation type. Here we present a global, spatially explicit and observation-based assessment of whole-ecosystem carbon turnover times that combines new estimates of vegetation and soil organic carbon stocks and fluxes. We find that the overall mean global carbon turnover time is 23(+7)(-4) years (95 per cent confidence interval). On average, carbon resides in the vegetation and soil near the Equator for a shorter time than at latitudes north of 75° north (mean turnover times of 15 and 255 years, respectively). We identify a clear dependence of the turnover time on temperature, as expected from our present understanding of temperature controls on ecosystem dynamics. Surprisingly, our analysis also reveals a similarly strong association between turnover time and precipitation. Moreover, we find that the ecosystem carbon turnover times simulated by state-of-the-art coupled climate/carbon-cycle models vary widely and that numerical simulations, on average, tend to underestimate the global carbon turnover time by 36 per cent. The models show stronger spatial relationships with temperature than do observation-based estimates, but generally do not reproduce the strong relationships with precipitation and predict faster carbon turnover in many semi-arid regions. Our findings suggest that future climate/carbon-cycle feedbacks may depend more strongly on changes in the hydrological cycle than is expected at present and is considered in Earth system models.},

In this case study based on A horizon samples of 2 California coniferous forests soils, we 1) evaluate the effects of root removal and ultrasonic dispersion on the properties of the {$<$}2 g cm-3 light fraction and 2) compare the properties of fractions obtained by sequential density separations of ultrasonically treated soil with those obtained by density followed by acid/base hydrolysis (Trumbore et al. 1996). A root-removal effort based on hand-picking visible roots reduced the radiocarbon content and increased the estimated turn-over time of the light fraction by roughly 12\%. Root-removal protocols that vary between investigators thus can potentially confound variability in carbon cycling for this fraction caused by environmental factors, such as climate. Ultrasonic dispersion did not have a clear effect on the light fraction C and N content or isotopic signature, but led to a decrease in the \% C and C/N of the recovered heavy fractions, and losses of 12-19\% of the total soil C to the sodium metatungstate density solution. Sequentially isolated density fractions clearly differed in mineralogy and organic matter chemistry, but natural-abundance 14C analyses indicated that distinct mineral phases did not correspond to unique C-turnover pools. Density fractions containing kaolinite group minerals alone and in combination with hydroxy-interlayered vermiculite were found to harbor both fast and slow cycling carbon. In contrast, severe chemical treatment isolated a carbon pool with the lowest overall 14C content and longest inferred mean turnover time. Overall, our results show that care must be taken when relying on physical (density) separation to isolate soil fractions with different dynamics, as the details of treatment will influence the results. © 2008 by the Arizona Board of Regents on behalf of the University of Arizona.},

Labile, 'high-quality', plant litters are hypothesized to promote soil organic matter (SOM) stabilization in mineral soil fractions that are physicochemically protected from rapid mineralization. However, the effect of litter quality on SOM stabilization is inconsistent. High-quality litters, characterized by high N concentrations, low C/N ratios, and low phenol/lignin concentrations, are not consistently stabilized in SOM with greater efficiency than 'low-quality' litters characterized by low N concentrations, high C/N ratios, and high phenol/lignin concentrations. Here, we attempt to resolve these inconsistent results by developing a new conceptual model that links litter quality to the soil C saturation concept. Our model builds on the Microbial Efficiency-Matrix Stabilization framework (Cotrufo et al., 2013) by suggesting the effect of litter quality on SOM stabilization is modulated by the extent of soil C saturation such that high-quality litters are not always stabilized in SOM with greater efficiency than low-quality litters.},

  abstract = {Density fractionation is frequently applied to separate soil organic matter according to the degree and the mode of interaction with minerals. Density fractions are operationally defined by density cut-off and sonication intensity, which determine the nature of the separated material. However, no tests or general agreements exist on the most appropriate density cut-off as well as on method and intensity of dispersion. Numerous variants have been proposed and applied, with results often contrasting each other and being hard to interpret. Here, we aimed at separating two light fractions (free and occluded into aggregates) composed of almost pure organic material, and one heavy fraction comprising the organic-mineral associations. We tested effects of different density cut-offs and sonication intensities, in combination and separately, on fraction yields, as well as on the fractions' organic carbon, total nitrogen and lignin-derived phenols. We tried to find optimum density cut-offs and sonication intensities, providing light fractions with maximum organic material and minimum contamination by mineral material. Under the test conditions, a density of 1.6gcm -3 gave best results for all test soils, allowing for separation of maximums amounts of almost pure organic material. The density cut-off at 1.6gcm -3 is well in line with previous studies and theoretical considerations, therefore we recommend the use of this density as most suitable for separation of organic debris. Sonication levels for aggregate disruption to achieve complete separation of occluded light organic matter varied amongst soils. The necessary intensity of dispersion relates to the type of soil, depending on the stability of contained aggregates. The application of one single dispersion energy level to different soils may result either in mineral contamination or in incomplete separation of light and heavy fractions as well as in redistribution of organic material amongst fractions. This means there is no single sonication level that can be applied to all soils. Thus, obtaining a meaningful light fraction residing within aggregates (occluded light fraction) requires assessment of the dispersion energy necessary to disrupt the aggregate system of a given soil without dispersion of organic-mineral associations. This can be done in pre-experiments where the soil is fractionated at different sonication levels. The appropriate dispersion is determined by mass yields and OC content of the obtained occluded fractions. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) stabilisation in subsoil horizons received much attention in recent years, due to the presence of compounds with very long residence times. The reasons for enhanced organic carbon stabilisation in subsoil horizons are poorly understood. In this study, we characterised SOM in adjacent soil compartments with different pedological functioning. We sampled SOM in visually identifiable zones in form of tongues and the adjacent soil matrix from deep soil horizons (60-140 cm depth) of 3 profiles under agricultural land. The samples were analysed for elemental and isotopic composition, radiocarbon age, chemical composition and lignin signature. The objective of the study was to examine if the tongues are characterised by contrasting carbon amounts and composition with regards to the soil matrix. Our results indicate that tongues have two times higher carbon content and are depleted in 15N with regards to the adjacent soil matrix. SOM in the tongues is characterised by up to modern radiocarbon ages, whereas SOM in the adjacent soil matrix is several thousand years old. Twenty percent more HF soluble carbon in the soil matrix suggest that more mineral bound, highly mobile SOM is present compared to tongues. Differences in chemical composition concern the lignin component, which seems to be preserved in the soil matrix. These data may be explained by different functioning in the two parts of the soil profile. In tongues, fresh carbon input by preferential flow and/or roots may lead to higher SOM turnover compared to the soil matrix. This heterogeneous distribution of stabilised SOM must be taken into account, when studying carbon sequestration in deep soil horizons. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In contrast, soil properties sometimes change suddenly and irreversibly in a threshold response to external stimuli or internal change in soil processes. Significant progress has been made in understanding the thermodynamics and kinetics of soil-property change. Even in the open soil system, the direction of change can be determined from measures of disequilibrium. Favorable reactions may proceed in parallel, but the most prevalent and rapid ones have the greatest impact on product formation. Simultaneous acid-base, ion exchange, redox and mineral-transformation reactions interact to determine the direction and rate of change. The nature of the governing reactions is such that soils are well buffered to pH change in the alkaline and strongly acid regions but far less so in the neutral to slightly acid zones. Organic matter inputs may drive oxidation-reduction processes through a stepwise consumption of electron acceptors (thereby producing thresholds) but disequilibrium among redox couples and regeneration of redox buffer capacity may attenuate this response. Synthesis of secondary minerals, ranging from carbonates and smectites to kaolinite and oxides, forms a basis for many of the reported cases of pedogenic inertia and thresholds. Mineralogical change tends to occur in a serial, irreversible fashion that, under favorable environmental conditions, can lead to large accumulations of specific minerals whose crystallinity evolves over time. These accumulations and associated "ripening" processes can channel soil processes along existing pathways or they can force thresholds by causing changes in water flux and kinetic pathways. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {Paddy soils are classified as wetlands which play a vital role in climatic change and food production. Soil carbon (C), especially soil organic C (SOC), in paddy soils has been received considerable attention as of recent. However, considerably less attention has been given to soil inorganic carbon (SIC) in paddy soils and the relationship between SOC and SIC at interface between soil and the atmosphere. The objective of this research was to investigate the utility of applying Fourier transform mid-infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy (FTIR-PAS) to explore SOC and SIC present near the surface (0-10 µm) of paddy soils. The FTIR-PAS spectra revealed an unique absorption region in the wavenumber range of 1,350-1,500 cm(-1) that was dominated by C-O (carbonate) and C-H bending vibrations (organic materials), and these vibrations were used to represented SIC and SOC, respectively. A circular distribution between SIC and SOC on the surface of paddy soils was determined using principal component analysis (PCA), and the distribution showed no significant relationship with the age of paddy soil. However, SIC and SOC were negatively correlated, and higher SIC content was observed near the soil surface. This relationship suggests that SIC in soil surface plays important roles in the soil C dynamics.},

Although soil bulk density determinations were absent at the first sampling time, we used bulk density values from the second sampling time calibrated against NIR spectra to predict the missing values. There was no detectable change in overall total soil C stock (mean±standard error, to a depth of 100cm), which was 266±15 and 270±15tCha-1 for the first and second sampling times, respectively, or generally in C stock within specific vegetation or soil types. The exception was for soils under woodland, excluding those on deep peat, which exhibited a significant (P=0.05) gain of 1.0tCha-1year-1. Soils under woodland (mainly coniferous plantation) also showed a significant (P=0.04) increase in C content (gkg-1), a significant decrease in bulk density (P=0.006) and an increase in the thickness of the Litter-Fermentation-Humus (LFH) layer (P=0.06). Recalculating the C stock to a depth of 15cm showed a significant increase in overall C stock (when deep peat sites were excluded) as well as specifically in moorland and woodland soils, suggesting that had we sampled only to 15cm, we would have reached a different conclusion. Both improved grassland soils and those initially under arable cultivation showed a significant decrease in C content. However, the mean thickness of Ap horizons increased from 29 to 32cm, with a concomitant decrease in C content and a slight increase in bulk density; this we ascribe to deeper ploughing between the sample periods. In the context of possible soil C losses, we can be 95\% confident that the mean loss does not exceed 0.2\%year-1 and 99\% confident that it does not exceed 0.4\%year-1. © 2013 British Society of Soil Science.},

The objective of this study was to analyze the composition and thermal stability of clay-associated organic matter (OM) at varying soil depths in the summit and footslope of a pasture hillslope using C X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and pyrolysis-field ionization mass spectrometry (Py-FIMS). C XANES showed aromatic C was relatively enriched in the subsoil, relative to the surface soil. Py-FIMS demonstrated a relative enrichment of phenols/lignin monomers and alkylaromatics with increasing profile depth in the summit soil, and to a greater extent in the footslope soil, followed by a decreasing abundance of sterols. In surface soil, the thermostability of clay-associated OM increases in the order: carbohydrates and N compounds {$<$} phenols/lignin monomers {$<$} lignin dimers and alkylaromatics, suggesting the intrinsic chemical nature of OM as a major driver for OM persistent in surface soil. The thermal stability of clay-associated carbohydrates, N compounds, and phenols/lignin monomers increased with profile depth, likely due to stronger organic-organic/organic-mineral binding. In subsoil, the thermal stability of clay-associated carbohydrates and N compounds can be as high as that of alkylaromatic and lignin dimers, implying that persistent subsoil OM could be composed of organic compound classes, like carbohydrates, that were traditionally considered as biochemically labile compounds. In contrast, the thermally-stable compound classes, like lignin dimers and alkylaromatics, showed no changes in the thermal stability with soil depth. This study suggests that stability of the more labile OM compounds may be more strongly influenced by the change in environmental conditions, relative to the more stable forms.},

However, the mechanisms underlying changes in soil C storage are not well understood, hampering long-term predictions of climate C-feedbacks. The activity of the extracellular enzymes ligninase and cellulase can be used to track changes in the predominant C sources of soil microbes and can thus provide mechanistic insights into soil C loss pathways. Here we show, using meta-analysis, that reductions in soil C stocks with warming are associated with increased ratios of ligninase to cellulase activity. Furthermore, whereas long-term (≥5 years) warming reduced the soil recalcitrant C pool by 14\%, short-term warming had no significant effect. Together, these results suggest that warming stimulates microbial utilization of recalcitrant C pools, possibly exacerbating long-term climate-C feedbacks.},

In order to conceptualize the role of legacy effects in MOM formation, we conducted sequential sorption experiments with kaolinite and gibbsite as minerals and DOM derived from forest floor materials. The MOM formation efficiency leveled off upon repeated addition of identical DOM solutions to minerals due to the retention of highly sorptive organic molecules (primarily aromatic, nitrogen-poor, hydrogen-poor, and oxygen-rich molecules), which decreased the sorption site availability and simultaneously modified the mineral surface charge. Organic–organic interactions as postulated in multilayer models played a negligible role in MOM formation. Continued exchange between DOM and MOM molecules upon repeated sorption altered the DOM composition but not the MOM formation efficiencies. Sorption-induced depletion of high-affinity compounds from solutions further decreased the MOM formation efficiencies to pristine minerals. Overall, the interplay between the differential sorptivities of DOM components and the mineral surface chemistry explains the legacy effects that contribute to the regulation of fluxes and the distribution of organic matter in the soil.},

We aimed to quantify how much of the organic matter in {$<$}�2��m particle-size fractions was free versus bound to minerals and to describe the nature of the association. Furthermore, we hypothesized that this bound organic matter was more resistant to biodegradation than free organic particles. We tested this by using a cultivation chronosequence on temperate silty soils and quantified free and clay-bound organic matter using density fractionation coupled with elemental analyses, as well as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) coupled with image analyses. Both methods showed that free organic matter was a minor fraction and that it was more depleted by cultivation than clay-bound organic matter. We deduced that clay-bound organic matter was more resistant to biodegradation. TEM showed that the distribution of organic matter in clay-sized fractions was patchy and that many of the so-called {$<$}�2��m �particles�Ewere in fact nanometre- to micrometre-sized microaggregates in which OM was encrusted by minerals or coated minerals. We conclude that true primary organo-mineral complexes do not correspond to reality and must be regarded as conceptual entities.

Quantitative information on distribution of SOC stocks is needed to construct a baseline for studying temporal changes in SOC. The spatial variation of soil short-range-order minerals such as allophane usually explains the variability of topsoil SOC contents, but SOC data for deeper soil layers are needed. We found that within a 1km2 Costa Rican basin covered by coffee agroforestry, SOC stocks in the upper 200 cm of soil were highly variable (24 to 72 kgCm−2). Topsoil SOC stocks were not correlated with SOC stocks present in deeper layers. Diffuse-reflectance mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy made possible the analysis of a large number of samples (69 soil profiles, i.e. 598 soil samples) for ammonium-oxalate and sodium-pyrophosphate- extractable forms of Al, Fe, and Si, as well as SOC content and bulk density. Using the MIR spectra, we identified two different soil materials, which were identified as allophanic and halloysitic soil material. Allophanic soil occurred on top of the halloysitic soil. The thickness of the allophanic soil material, rich in SRO minerals and related to a young andic A horizon, explained the variability of SOC. This study illustrates that knowledge of topography and pedogenesis is needed to understand and extrapolate the distribution of SOC stocks at landscape scales.},

The amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), which is referred to as heterotrophic respiration (Rh), is technically difficult to measure despite its necessity to the understanding of how to protect and increase soil carbon stocks. Within this context, the aim of this study is to determine Rh in two Mediterranean forests dominated by pine and oak using radiocarbon measurements of the bulk SOC from different soil layers. The annual Rh was 3.22 Mg C ha −1 y −1 under pine and 3.13 Mg C ha −1 y −1 under oak, corresponding to 38 and 31\% of the annual soil respiration, respectively. The accuracy of the Rh values was evaluated by determining the net primary production (NPP), as the sum of the Rh and the net ecosystem production measured by eddy covariance, then comparing it with the NPP obtained through independent biometric measurements. No significant differences were observed, which suggested the suitability of our methodology to infer Rh. Assuming the C inputs to soil to consist exclusively of the aboveground and belowground litter and the C output exclusively of the Rh, both soils were C sinks, which is consistent with a previous modeling study that was performed in the same stands. In conclusion, radiocarbon analysis of bulk SOC provided a reliable estimate of the average annual amount of soil carbon released to the atmosphere; hence, its application is convenient for calculating Rh because it utilizes only a single soil sampling and no time-consuming monitoring activities.},

Parent mineralogy is dominated by glass, olivine, pyroxene, and feldspar, whereas poorly crystalline (PC) weathering products (allophane, microcrystalline gibbsite, ferrihydrite) accumulate in early to intermediate weathering stages (through 400 ky), and crystalline secondary minerals (kaolinite, gibbsite, goethite) are dominant in the oldest (1400 and 4100 ky) soils. Detailed characterization of the solid phase was accomplished with chemical extractions, X-ray diffraction analysis, and molecular spectroscopy (FTIR and 13C MAS NMR). Simultaneous proton titration and background ion adsorption measurements were made on LiCl saturated soils over a range in pH (2-9) and ionic strength (0.001 and 0.01 M LiCl). Dependence of variable surface charge on solution composition reflects the changing nature of mineral-organic interactions over the course of pedogenesis. Points of zero net proton charge (PZNPC) ranged from 3.4 to 6.2 and 2.0 to 5.8 at 0.001 and 0.01 M ionic strength (I), respectively. Intermediate-aged soils containing the highest mass concentration of humified soil organic matter (SOM) and its complexes with PC minerals gave rise to the steepest charging curves (largest pH dependence) and highest PZNPC values. Surface charge properties of these soils most closely reflected their weakly acidic Al and Fe hydroxide constituents, which is consistent with metal hydroxide saturation of organic functional groups, rather than organic coating of mineral surfaces. Charging curves were less steep and PZNPC values were lower for the older soils, consistent with SOM coating of more crystalline goethite, kaolinite, and gibbsite surfaces in a soil system less impacted by labile Al and Fe.

  abstract = {Drying and rewetting are common events in soils during summer, particularly in Mediterranean climate where soil microbes may be further challenged by salinity. Previous studies in non-saline soils have shown that rewetting induces a flush of soil respiration, but little is known about how the extent of drying affects the size of the respiration flush or how drying and rewetting affects soil respiration in saline soils. Five sandy loam soils, ranging in electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract (ECe) from 2 to 48 dS m?1 (EC2, EC9, EC19, EC33 and EC48), were kept at soil water content optimal for respiration or dried for 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 days (referred to 1D, 2D, 3D, 4D and 5D) and maintained at the achieved water content for 4 days. Then the soils were rewet to optimal water content and incubated moist for 5 days. Water potential decreased with increasing drying time; in the 5D treatment, the water potential ranged between ?15 and ?30 MPa, with the lowest potentials in soil EC33. In moist and dry conditions, respiration rates per unit soil organic C (SOC) were highest in soil EC19. Respiration rates decreased with increasing time of drying; when expressed relative to constantly moist soil, the decline was similar in all soils. Rewetting of soils only induced a flush of respiration compared to constantly moist soil when the soils were dried for 3 or more days. The flush in respiration was greatest in 5D and smallest in 3D, and greater in EC2 than in the saline soils. Cumulative respiration per unit SOC was highest in soil EC19 and lowest in soil EC2 Cumulative respiration decreased with increasing time of drying, but in a given soil, the relationship between water potential during the dry phase and cumulative respiration at the end of the experiment was weaker than that between respiration rate during drying and water potential. In conclusion, rewetting induced a flush in respiration only if the water potential of the soils was previously decreased at least 3-fold compared to the constantly moist soil. Hence, only marked increases in water potential induce a flush in respiration upon rewetting. The smaller flush in respiration upon rewetting of saline soils suggests that these soils may be less prone to lose C when exposed to drying and rewetting compared to non-saline soils.},

  abstract = {Soil respiration is derived from heterotrophic (decomposition of soil organic matter) and autotrophic (root/rhizosphere respiration) sources, but there is considerable uncertainty about what factors control variations in their relative contributions in space and time. We took advantage of a unique whole-ecosystem radiocarbon label in a temperate forest to partition soil respiration into three sources: (1) recently photosynthesized carbon (C), which dominates root and rhizosphere respiration; (2) leaf litter decomposition and (3) decomposition of root litter and soil organic matter {$>$} 1-2 years old. Heterotrophic sources and specifically leaf litter decomposition were large contributors to total soil respiration during the growing season. Relative contributions from leaf litter decomposition ranged from a low of similar to 1 3\% of total soil respiration (6 3 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) when leaf litter was extremely dry, to a high of 42 16\% (96 38 mg C m(-2) h(-1)). Total soil respiration fluxes varied with the strength of the leaf litter decomposition source, indicating that moisture-dependent changes in litter decomposition drive variability in total soil respiration fluxes. In the surface mineral soil layer, decomposition of C fixed in the original labeling event (3-5 years earlier) dominated the isotopic signature of heterotrophic respiration accounted for 16 10\% to 64 22\% of total soil respiration, with highest relative contributions coinciding with low overall soil respiration fluxes. In contrast to leaf litter decomposition, root respiration fluxes did not exhibit marked temporal variation ranging from 34 14 to 40 16 mg C m(-2) h(-1) at different times in the growing season with a single exception (88 35 mg C m(-2) h(-1)). Radiocarbon signatures of root respired CO2 changed markedly between early and late spring (March vs. May), suggesting a switch from stored nonstructural carbohydrate sources to more recent photosynthetic products.},

Although reducing emissions from fossil fuels is essential for meeting this goal, other sources of emissions may also preclude its attainment. We show that even if fossil fuel emissions were immediately halted, current trends in global food systems would prevent the achievement of the 1.5°C target and, by the end of the century, threaten the achievement of the 2°C target. Meeting the 1.5°C target requires rapid and ambitious changes to food systems as well as to all nonfood sectors. The 2°C target could be achieved with less-ambitious changes to food systems, but only if fossil fuel and other nonfood emissions are eliminated soon.},

  abstract = {We investigated the seasonal patterns of denitrification rates and potentials in soil profiles along the topohydrosequence formed at the upland-wetland interface in three riparian wetlands with different vegetation cover (i.e., forest, understory vegetation, and grass). Denitrification was measured using the acetylene inhibition method on soil cores and slurries, which provided a means of comparing the relative activity of this process in different locations. We evaluated, on a seasonal basis, the respective importance of the vegetative cover and the hydromorphic gradient as factors limiting denitrification. Regardless of the season, vegetation type, or lateral position along each topohydrosequence in the riparian wetlands, strong significant gradients of both in situ and potential denitrification rates were measured within a soil profile. Results confirm that the upper organic soil horizon is the most active, when in contact with the ground water. In deeper soil horizons, denitrification activity was low (from 0.004 to 0.5 mg N kg(-1) dry soil d(-1)), but contributed significantly to the reduction of ground water NO3- load along the riparian ground water flowpath (from 9.32 to 0.98 mg NO3-N L(-1)). Along the soil topohydrosequence, the denitrifying community of the upper soil horizons did not vary significantly on a seasonal basis despite the large seasonal ground water fluctuations. Along each topohydrosequence, the denitrification-limiting factor gradually shifted from anaerobiosis to NO3- supply. In situ denitrification rates in the forested, understory vegetation and grass sites were not significantly different. This result emphasizes the importance of the topography of the valley rather than the vegetation cover in controlling denitrification activity in riparian wetlands.},

Excellent performance was achieved over an extensive geographic and chemical diversity of soils. A single model for all soil types performed very well with a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 12.6 g kg-1 and was further improved if Histosols were excluded (RMSEP 11.1 g kg-1). Exclusion of Histosols was particularly beneficial for accurate prediction of CO3 values when the national model was applied to an independent regional dataset. Little advantage was found in further narrowing the taxonomic breadth of the calibration dataset, but higher precision was obtained by running models for a restricted range of CO3. A model calibrated using only on the independent regional dataset, was unable to accurately predict CO3 content for the more chemically diverse national dataset. Ten absorbance peaks enabling CO3 prediction by mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy were identified and evaluated for individual and combined predictive power. A single-band model derived from an absorbance peak centered at 1796 cm-yielded the lowest RMSEP of 13.5 g kg-1 for carbonate prediction compared to other single-band models. This predictive power is attributed to the strength and sharpness of the peak, and an apparent minimal overlap with confounding co-occurring spectral features of other soil components. Drawing from the 10 identified bands, multiple combinations of 3 or 4 peaks were able to predict CO3 content as well as the full-spectrum national models. Soil CO3 is an excellent example of a soil parameter that can be predicted with great effectiveness and generality, and MIR models could replace direct laboratory measurement as a lower cost, high quality alternative.},

However, none of these benefits will be possible until changes in C stocks can be documented accurately and cost-effectively. This is particularly challenging when dealing with changes in soil organic C (SOC) stocks. Precise methods for measuring C in soil samples are well established, but spatial variability in the factors that determine SOC stocks makes it difficult to document change. Widespread interest in the benefits of SOC sequestration has brought this issue to the fore in the development of US and international climate policy. Here, we review the challenges to documenting changes in SOC stocks, how policy decisions influence offset documentation requirements, and the benefits and drawbacks of different sampling strategies and extrapolation methods.},

  abstract = {The response of soil organic matter (OM) decomposition to increasing temperature is a critical aspect of ecosystem responses to global change. The impacts of climate warming on decomposition dynamics have not been resolved due to apparently contradictory results from field and lab experiments, most of which has focused on labile carbon with short turnover times. But the majority of total soil carbon stocks are comprised of organic carbon with turnover times of decades to centuries. Understanding the response of these carbon pools to climate change is essential for forecasting longer-term changes in soil carbon storage. Herein, we briefly synthesize information from recent studies that have been conducted using a wide variety of approaches. In our effort to understand research to-date, we derive a new conceptual model that explicitly identifies the processes controlling soil OM availability for decomposition and allows a more explicit description of the factors regulating OM decomposition under different circumstances. It explicitly defines resistance of soil OM to decomposition as being due either to its chemical conformation (quality) or its physico-chemical protection from decomposition. The former is embodied in the depolymerization process, the latter by adsorption/desorption and aggregate turnover. We hypothesize a strong role for variation in temperature sensitivity as a function of reaction rates for both. We conclude that important advances in understanding the temperature response of the processes that control substrate availability, depolymerization, microbial efficiency, and enzyme production will be needed to predict the fate of soil carbon stocks in a warmer world.},

Such zones are based on the classification of field sites into groups of homogeneous features. Multiple causative agents of variability and the response of agricultural crops should be considered for zoning. Several correlated variables are usually measured and georeferenced for this purpose at multiple sites within the field. This paper presents an approach to promoting the integration of different statistical tools for identifying homogeneous zones based on site covariates. The methodological innovation of this work involves cleaning and re-scaling of spatial data, as well as multivariate and geostatistical analyses in a logical sequence (protocol). Statistical topics for further improvement and protocol applications are noted. The analytical process has been illustrated using a rain-fed wheat crop (60 ha) from the Argentine Pampas, with apparent electrical conductivity, elevation and soil depth as master variables for zoning, and yield, soil organic matter and clay to validate the created management zones; however, it may be applied to other production systems using georeferenced data.

Plant litters with high rates of mineralization (high quality litters) are hypothesized to promote the accumulation of MAOM with greater efficiency than plant litters with low rates of mineralization (low-quality litters) because litters with high rates of mineralization maximize the synthesis of microbial products and most MAOM is microbial-derived. However, the effect of litter quality on MAOM is inconsistent. We conducted four repeated short-term incubations (46-d each) of four plant litters (alfalfa, oats, maize and soybean) in two low-carbon subsoils (sandy loam and silty loam) with and without nutrient addition. Our short-term incubations focused on the initial stage of litter decomposition during the time when litter quality has a measureable effect on mineralization rates. Plant litter quality had a much greater effect on litter-C mineralization rate and MAOM-C accumulation than did soil type or nutrient addition. Soils amended with high-quality oat and alfalfa litters had greater MAOM-C accumulation than soils amended with low-quality maize and soybean litters. However, soils amended with high-quality litters also had greater litter-C mineralization than soils amended with low-quality litters. As a result, the accumulation of MAOM-C per unit of litter-C mineralization was lower in soils amended with high-vs. low-quality litters (0.65 vs. 1.39 g MAOM-C accumulated g−1 C mineralized). Cellulose and hemicelluose indices of accumulated MAOM were greater for maize and soybean than oats and alfalfa, however, most carbohydrates in MAOM were plant-derived regardless of litter quality. At the end of the incubations, more of the accumulated MAOM-N was potentially mineralizable in soils amended with high quality litters. Nevertheless, most of the litter-C remained as residual litter; just 12\% was mineralized to CO2 and 13\% was transferred to MAOM. Our results demonstrate several unexpected effects of litter quality on MAOM stabilization including the direct stabilization of plant-derived carbohydrates.},

We present the current understanding of the importance of microbial substrate use efficiency and C and N allocation in controlling the proportion of plant-derived C and N that is incorporated into SOM, and of soil matrix interactions in controlling SOM stabilization. We synthesize this understanding into the Microbial Efficiency-Matrix Stabilization (MEMS) framework. This framework leads to the hypothesis that labile plant constituents are the dominant source of microbial products, relative to input rates, because they are utilized more efficiently by microbes. These microbial products of decomposition would thus become the main precursors of stable SOM by promoting aggregation and through strong chemical bonding to the mineral soil matrix.},

  abstract = {Tropical forest soils contribute disproportionately to the poorly-characterized and persistent deep soil carbon (C) pool. These soils, highly-weathered and often extending one to two meters in depth, may contain an abundance of iron-(Fe) bearing mineral phases. Short-range-order (SRO) minerals are of particular interest due to their high reactive surface areas and capacity for soil C stabilization through sorption or co-precipitation. We hypothesized that SRO minerals might serve as primary contributors to soil C accumulation and storage in surface (0–20 cm) and subsurface (50–80 cm) soils of the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory (LCZO) in northeast Puerto Rico. Oxisol and Inceptisol soils obtained from 20 quantitative soil pits, stratified across quartz-dominated granodiorite and clay-rich volcaniclastic parent materials, were subjected to selective dissolution procedures to extract Fe-C associations: sodium pyrophosphate (PP) to isolate colloidal or dispersable Fe, HCl-hydroxylamine (HH) and ammonium oxalate (AO) to isolate SRO Fe, and inorganic dithionite-HCl (DH) to isolate more crystalline pedogenic Fe. Pyrophosphate extraction of colloidal or dispersable Fe also extracted the greatest concentrations of soluble C across all samples. Dissolved molar C:Fe ratios {$>$} 1 observed solely in the PP extracts indicated the presence of organic-rich non-sorptive associations, the stability of which may have stronger control on accumulation of total soil C in these soils than those of extractable SRO and pedogenic Fe. Pedogenic and SRO Fe phases were the dominant extractable minerals in both soil types, at the surface and at depth, and notably, correlated well with extracted C. This suggests that these phases are strongly associated with a smaller, but substantial, fraction of total soil C. Direct observations of the limited extractability of soil C ({$<$} 50\% in surface soils) during selective dissolution of Fe and the lack of correlations between extractable Fe minerals and total soil C concentrations did not support the common hypothesis that SRO mineral phases provide a dominant mechanism for soil C accumulation. Instead, SRO phases may control only a fraction of total soil C, and non-extractable Fe-bearing minerals and non-sorptive mechanisms may play more important roles than previously thought.},

  abstract = {While the importance of organic matter adsorption onto reactive iron-bearing mineral surfaces to carbon stabilization in soils and sediments has been well- established, fundamental understanding of how compounds assemble at the mineral interface remains elusive. Organic matter is thought to layer sequentially onto the mineral surface, forming molecular architecture stratified by bond strength and compound polarity. However, prominent complexation models lack experimental backing, despite the role of such architecture in fractionated, compound-dependent persistence of organic matter and modulating future perturbations in mineral stabilization capacity. Here, we use kinetic assays and ultrahigh resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry under high temporal frequency to directly detect the molecular partitioning of organic matter onto an iron oxyhydroxide during adsorption. We observed three sequential intervals of discrete molecular composition throughout the adsorption reaction, in which rapid primary adsorption of aromatic compounds was followed by secondary lignin-like and tertiary aliphatic compounds. These findings, paired with observed differential fractionation along formulas nitrogen and oxygen content and decreasing selective sorption with reaction time, support “zonal” assembly models. This work presents direct detection of sequential molecular assembly of organic matter at the mineral interface, an important yet abstruse regulator of carbon stabilization and composition across temporal and spatial scales.},

  abstract = {Soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles are inextricably linked, yet the impacts of N availability upon soil C sequestration and turnover are poorly understood. According to stoichiometric theory, in the absence of nutrient limitation substrate decomposition will reach maximum rates, with C assimilated into microbial biomass at the expense of CO2 production. In this study, we added a 14C labelled low molecular weight substrate (glucose) to a sandy soil along with eleven increasing levels of N, phosphorus (P), and sulphur (S) in relative proportions as required for microbial biomass production. Adding a simple soluble substrate allowed us to explicitly examine changes in microbial transformations of added C, rather than changes resulting from extracellular enzyme activity or the extent of substrate decomposition. We hypothesized that as nutrient addition increased, an increasing proportion of the glucose-C provided would be incorporated into microbial biomass at the expense of CO2 production and stabilized as soil organic carbon (SOC). Instead, CO2 production from glucose-C increased significantly with nutrient addition without measurable changes in glucose-derived microbial biomass or SOC. This suggests that if there was greater glucose-derived microbial biomass produced under higher nutrient addition it was offset by a higher rate of microbial biomass turnover. We also found greater soil-derived microbial biomass at lower nutrient addition levels, potentially supporting the concept of microbial mining of soil organic matter (SOM) for nutrients under low nutrient availability. In conclusion, our data suggest that in a sandy soil with low capacity for physical protection of SOM, nutrient addition does not immediately promote C sequestration in the soil microbial community, and that the interaction between C stabilization and nutrient addition requires further work, especially for predicting ecosystem responses.},

Microbial necromass (the accumulated cellular residues of microorganisms) comprises the majority of soil C, yet the formation and persistence of necromass in relation to mineralogy is poorly understood. We tested whether soil minerals had different microbial necromass association mechanisms. Specifically, we tested whether microbial necromass directly sorbed to mineral surfaces or was consumed by live microorganisms prior to mineral association. Applying Raman microspectroscopy with 13C enriched microbial necromass to quantify microbe-mineral interactions, we show that mineralogy alters the initial mechanism of microbial necromass association. In the presence of K-feldspar (lower abiotic C preservation potential), microbial necromass required assimilation by live microorganisms for mineral retention. In contrast, with amorphous aluminum hydroxide (higher abiotic C preservation potential) microbial necromass was retained predominately through abiotic sorption, and was subsequently protected from microbial decomposition. Despite different mechanisms, both minerals retained similar quantities of microbial necromass under biotic conditions. Mineralogy determined not only the quantity of mineral-associated C, but the distinct pathway of microbial necromass association. These findings show the utility of Raman microspectroscopy as a technique to study microbe-mineral interactions, and imply that heterogeneity in mineral-organic interactions could result in gradients of organic matter stability.},

  abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) is often separated by physical means to simplify a complex matrix into discrete fractions. A frequent approach to isolating two or more fractions is based on differing particle densities and uses a high density liquid such as sodium polytungstate (SPT). Soil density fractions are often interpreted as organic matter pools with different carbon (C) turnover times, ranging from years to decades or centuries, and with different functional roles for C and nutrient dynamics. In this paper, we discuss the development and mechanistic basis of common density-based methods for dividing soil into distinct organic matter fractions. Further, we directly address the potential effects of dispersing soil in a high density salt solution on the recovered fractions and implications for data interpretation. Soil collected from forested sites at H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon and Bousson Experimental Forest, Pennsylvania was separated into light and heavy fractions by floatation in a 1.6 g cm-3 solution of SPT. Mass balance calculations revealed that between 17\% and 26\% of the original bulk soil C and N content was mobilized and subsequently discarded during density fractionation for both soils. In some cases, the light isotope was preferentially mobilized during density fractionation. During a year-long incubation, mathematically recombined density fractions respired ∼40\% less than the bulk soil at both sites and light fraction (LF) did not always decompose more than the heavy fraction (HF). Residual amounts of tungsten (W) present even in well-rinsed fractions were enough to reduce microbial respiration by 27\% compared to the control in a 90-day incubation of Oa material. However, residual W was nearly eliminated by repeated leaching over the year-long incubation, and is not likely the primary cause of the difference in respiration between summed fractions and bulk soil. Light fraction at Bousson, a deciduous site developed on Alfisols, had a radiocarbon-based mean residence time (MRT) of 2.7 or 89 years, depending on the interpretation of the radiocarbon model, while HF was 317 years. In contrast, both density fractions from H. J. Andrews, a coniferous site developed on andic soils, had approximately the same MRT (117 years and 93 years for LF and HF). At H. J. Andrews the organic matter lost during density separation had a short MRT (19 years) and can account for the difference in respired CO 2 between the summed fractions and the bulk soil. Recognition and consideration of the effects of the density separation procedure on the recovered fractions will help prevent misinterpretation and deepen our understanding of the specific role of the recovered organic matter fractions in the ecological context of the soil studied. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

Despite limited reports of positive correlations with particulate organic C (POC), microbi- al biomass C (MBC), and other soil C fractions, little is known about what soil fractions POXC most closely refl ects. We measured POXC across a wide range of soil types, ecosystems, and geographic areas (12 studies, 53 total sites, n = 1379) to: (i) determine the relationship between POXC and POC, MBC and soil organic C (SOC) fractions, and (ii) determine the relative sen- sitivity of POXC as a labile soil C metric across a range of environmental and management conditions. Permanganate oxidizable C was signifi cantly related to POC, MBC, and SOC, and these relationships were strongest when data were analyzed by individual studies. Permanganate oxidizable C was more closely related to smaller-sized (53–250 μm) than larger POC fractions (250– 2000 μm), and more closely related to heavier ({$>$}1.7 g cm−3) than lighter POC fractions, indicating that it refl ects a relatively processed pool of labile soil C. Compared with POC, MBC, or SOC, POXC demonstrated greater sen- sitivity to changes in management or environmental variation in 42\% of the signifi cant experimental factors examined across the 12 studies.

Conclusions and future research 10 Acknowledgements 11 References 12 SUMMARY: The ecosystem has served as a central organizational concept in ecology for nearly a half century and continues to evolve. As a level in the biotic hierarchy, ecosystems are often viewed as ecological communities integrated with their abiotic environments. This has always been imperfect because of a mismatch of scales between communities and ecosystem processes as they are made operational for field study. Complexity theory has long been forecasted to provide a renewed foundation for ecosystem theory but has been slow to do so. Partly this has arisen from a difficulty in translating theoretical tenets into operational terms for testing in field studies. Ecosystem science has become an important applied science for studying global change and human environmental impacts. Vigorous and important directions in the study of ecosystems today include a growing focus on human-dominated landscapes and development of the concept of ecosystem services for human resource supply and well-being. Today, terrestrial ecosystems are viewed less as well-defined entities or as a level in the biotic hierarchy. Instead, ecosystem processes are being increasingly viewed as the elements in a hierarchy. These occur alongside landscape processes and socioeconomic processes, which combine to form coupled social-ecological systems across a range of scales.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) deposition is projected to increase significantly in tropical regions in the coming decades, where changes in climate are also expected. Additional N and warming each have the potential to alter soil carbon (C) storage via changes in microbial activity and decomposition, but little is known about the combined effects of these global change factors in tropical ecosystems. In this study, we used controlled laboratory incubations of soils from a long-term N fertilization experiment to explore the sensitivity of soil C to increased N in two N-rich tropical forests. We found that fertilization corresponded to significant increases in bulk soil C concentrations, and decreases in C loss via heterotrophic respiration (P{$<$} 0.05). The increase in soil C was not uniform among C pools, however. The active soil C pool decomposed faster with fertilization, while slowly cycling C pools had longer turnover times. These changes in soil C cycling with N additions corresponded to the responses of two groups of microbial extracellular enzymes. Smaller active C pools corresponded to increased hydrolytic enzyme activities; longer turnover times of the slowly cycling C pool corresponded to reduced activity of oxidative enzymes, which degrade more complex C compounds, in fertilized soils. Warming increased soil respiration overall, and N fertilization significantly increased the temperature sensitivity of slowly cycling C pools in both forests. In the lower elevation forest, respired CO2 from fertilized cores had significantly higher Δ14C values than control soils, indicating losses of relatively older soil C. These results indicate that soil C storage is sensitive to both N deposition and warming in N-rich tropical soils, with interacting effects of these two global change factors. N deposition has the potential to increase total soil C stocks in tropical forests, but the long-term stability of this added C will likely depend on future changes in temperature. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

The transect of seven soils formed in granitic residuum spans elevations from 198 to 2865 m with mean annual temperature and precipitation differences of 13°C (3.9-16.7) and 94 cm (33-127), respectively. Soil PH decreased by about two units and base saturation decreased from 90 to 10\% with increasing elevation. Concentrations of organic C in the solum increased with elevation, with the largest single increase occurring between the oak woodland (5-6 kg C/m2) and mixed-conifer sites (10-15 kg C/m2). Clay mineralogy showed a general trend of desilication and hydroxy-Al interlayering of 2:1 layer silicates with increasing elevation. The degree of chemical weathering, based on clay and secondary Fe oxide concentrations in the solum, showed a maximum (clay = 536 kg/m2 and Fe oxides = 24 kg/m2) at mid-elevations having intermediate levels of precipitation and temperature. While some soil properties show a continuous progression (e.g., organic carbon, base saturation, clay mineralogy) with elevation, other properties (e.g, pH, soil color, clay and secondary Fe oxide concentrations) show a pronounced change (threshold-type step) over a short distance at about 1600 m. The explanation for the abrupt nature of this shift is not known; however, it coincides with the approximate elevation of the present-day average effective winter snow-line.},

The comparison of isotopic ratios of tree leaves and roots at different depths showed that most of the Sr accumulation in Eucalyptus globulus and Pinus pinaster growing on shallow and poor soils in this rainy climate originated from the upper soil layers. As Ca and Sr behave similarly in the soil-plant system, this conclusion can be applied to Ca. This superficial uptake is attributed to the low availability of Sr and Ca in the soil as well as to the shortness of the drought period as compared to the length of the growth period. This technique appears to offer a promising way of studying relative root distributions in soils and plant competition for nutrients. Introduction},

The efficiency of MCP in heterotrophic microorganisms is related to the mechanisms of energy transduction employed and hence is related to the form of respiration utilized. Anaerobic organisms typically have lower efficiencies of energy transduction and hence lower efficiencies of energy-dependent carbon transformation. This leads to a lower MCP efficiency on a per-cell basis. Substantial input of terrigenous nutrients and organic matter into estuarine ecosystems typically results in elevated heterotrophic respiration that rapidly consumes dissolved oxygen, potentially producing hypoxic and anoxic zones in the water column. The lowered availability of dissolved oxygen and the excessive supply of nutrients such as nitrate from river discharge lead to enhanced anaerobic respiration processes such as denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium. Thus, some nutrients may be consumed through anaerobic heterotrophs, instead of being utilized by phytoplankton for autotrophic carbon fixation. In this manner, eutrophied estuarine ecosystems become largely fueled by anaerobic respiratory pathways and their efficiency is less due to lowered ecosystem productivity when compared to healthy and balanced estuarine ecosystems. This situation may have a negative impact on the ecological function and efficiency of the MCP which depends on the supply of both organic carbon and metabolic energy. This review presents our current understanding of the MCP mechanisms from the view point of ecosystem energy transduction efficiency, which has not been discussed in previous literature.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Significantly more carbon is stored in the world's soils - including peatlands, wetlands and permafrost - than is present in the atmosphere. Disagreement exists, however, regarding the effects of climate change on global soil carbon stocks. If carbon stored belowground is transferred to the atmosphere by a warming-induced acceleration of its decomposition, a positive feedback to climate change would occur. Conversely, if increases of plant-derived carbon inputs to soils exceed increases in decomposition, the feedback would be negative. Despite much research, a consensus has not yet emerged on the temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition. Unravelling the feedback effect is particularly difficult, because the diverse soil organic compounds exhibit a wide range of kinetic properties, which determine the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of their decomposition. Moreover, several environmental constraints obscure the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of substrate decomposition, causing lower observed 'apparent' temperature sensitivity, and these constraints may, themselves, be sensitive to climate. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

  abstract = {Coffea arabica (Arabica) and C. canephora (robusta) almost entirely dominate global coffee production. Various challenges at the production (farm) level, including the increasing prevalence and severity of disease and pests and climate change, indicate that the coffee crop portfolio needs to be substantially diversified in order to ensure resilience and sustainability. In this study, we use a multidisciplinary approach (herbarium and literature review, fieldwork and DNA sequencing) to elucidate the identity, whereabouts, and potential attributes, of two poorly known coffee crop species: C. affinis and C. stenophylla. We show that despite widespread (albeit small-scale) use as a coffee crop species across Upper West Africa and further afield more than 100 years ago, these species are now extremely rare in the wild and are not being farmed. Fieldwork enabled us to rediscover C. stenophylla in Sierra Leone, which previously had not been recorded in the wild there since 1954. We confirm that C. stenophylla is an indigenous species in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Ivory Coast. Coffea affinis was discovered in the wild in Sierra Leone for the first time, having previously been found only in Guinea and Ivory Coast. Prior to our rediscovery, C. affinis was last seen in the wild in 1941, although sampling of an unidentified herbarium specimen reveals that it was collected in Guinea-Conakry in 2015. DNA sequencing using plastid and ITS markers was used to: (1) confirm the identity of museum and field collected samples of C. stenophylla; (2) identify new accessions of C. affinis; (3) refute hybrid status for C. affinis; (4) identify accessions confused with C. affinis; (5) show that C. affinis and C. stenophylla are closely related, and possibly a single species; (6) substantiate the hybrid C. stenophylla × C. liberica; (7) demonstrate the use of plastid and nuclear markers as a simple means of identifying F1 and early-generation interspecific hybrids in Coffea; (8) infer that C. liberica is not monophyletic; and (9) show that hybridization is possible across all the major groups of key Africa Coffea species (Coffee Crop Wild Relative Priority Groups I and II). Coffea affinis and C. stenophylla may possess useful traits for coffee crop plant development, including taste differentiation, disease resistance, and climate resilience. These attributes would be best accessed via breeding programs, although the species may have niche-market potential via minimal domestication.},

  abstract = {In order to evaluate the sustainability and efficiency of soil carbon sequestration measures and the impact of different management and environmental factors, information on soil organic matter (SOM) stability and mean residence time (MRT) is required. However, this information on SOM stability and MRT is expensive to determine via radiocarbon dating, precluding a wide spread use of stability measurements in soil science. In this paper, we test an alternative method, first developed by Conen etal. (2008) for undisturbed Alpine grassland systems, using C and N stable isotope ratios in more frequently disturbed agricultural soils. Since only information on carbon and nitrogen concentrations and their stable isotope ratios is required, it is possible to estimate the SOM stability at greatly reduced costs compared to radiocarbon dating. Using four different experimental sites located in various climates and soil types, this research proved the effectiveness of using the C/N ratio and δ\textsuperscript{15}N signature to determine the stability of mOM (mineral associated organic matter) relative to POM (particulate organic matter) in an intensively managed agro-ecological setting. Combining this approach with δ\textsuperscript{13}C measurements allowed discriminating between different management (grassland vs cropland) and land use (till vs no till) systems. With increasing depth the stability of mOM relative to POM increases, but less so under tillage compared to no-till practises. Applying this approach to investigate SOM stability in different soil aggregate fractions, it corroborates the aggregate hierarchy theory as proposed by Six etal. (2004) and Segoli etal. (2013). The organic matter in the occluded micro-aggregate and silt \& clay fractions is less degraded than the SOM in the free micro-aggregate and silt \& clay fractions. The stable isotope approach can be particularly useful for soils with a history of burning and thus containing old charcoal particles, preventing the use of \textsuperscript{14}C to determine the SOM stability.},

Using a map of carbon content with associated uncertainty, it optimizes stratified random sampling: number of strata, stratum boundaries, total sample size and sample sizes within strata. The optimization maximizes the expected profit for the farmer on the basis of sequestered carbon price, sampling costs, and a trading parameter that balances farmer's and buyer's risks due to uncertainty of the estimated amount of sequestered carbon. The stratification is optimized by a novel method (. Ospats), an iterative procedure that re-allocates grid points to strata on the basis of pairwise differences between predictions and covariances of prediction errors. Optimal sample sizes are calculated from variance predictions by Ospats. An application on an Australian farm has shown that soil carbon changes across farms and regions can be audited effectively using the proposed method. It is concluded that sample bulking and returning to the same sites in subsequent sampling rounds are not recommendable.},

By combining a cross-biome global field survey, including data for 32 soil, plant, and microbial properties in 16 soil chronosequences, with a global meta-analysis, we show that soil age is a significant ecosystem driver, but only accounts for a relatively small proportion of the cross-biome variation in multiple ecosystem properties. Parent material, climate, vegetation and topography predict, collectively, 24 times more variation in ecosystem properties than soil age alone. Soil age is an important local-scale ecosystem driver; however, environmental context, rather than soil age, determines the rates and trajectories of ecosystem development in structure and function across biomes. Our work provides insights into the natural history of terrestrial ecosystems. We propose that, regardless of soil age, changes in the environmental context, such as those associated with global climatic and land-use changes, will have important long-term impacts on the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystems across biomes.},

To determine the level of compaction of mine soils, bulk density is measured. The traditional method of soil cores for measuring bulk density is diffi cult and prone to errors in rocky materials used for mine reclamation. We selected four methods (foam, frame, sand cone, and radiation) to determine bulk density at a depth of 15 cm in four mine soils and one forest soil, all having rock fragment contents {$>$} 30\%. Bulk density values by sand cone were signifi cantly lower (average of 1.35 Mg m-3) than bulk densities determined by the other three methods (averages of 1.64–1.76 Mg m-3). The sand cone was lower because the metal plate was sometimes not fl ush with the soil surface because of rock protrusions. For soils, the native forest soil showed an average bulk density across methods of 1.05 Mg m-3, while the mine soils ranged from 1.70 to 1.84 Mg m-3. Standard deviations for each method across soils (n = 25) ranged from 6\% for radiation to 19\% for the sand cone. In-fi eld time effi ciency was shortest for the radiation method at 6 min per sample, compared with 10 min for foam, 14 min for sand cone, and 27 min for the frame. The radiation method had the lowest standard deviation (better reproducibility) and better time effi ciency than the other methods.},

A thermal reaction chamber coupled with an infrared gas cell was used to study the pattern of thermal evolution of carbon dioxide (CO\textsubscript{2}) in order to relate evolved gas (i.e., CO\textsubscript{2}) to different qualities of SOM. Soil samples were taken from three different arable sites in Germany: (i) the Static Fertilization Experiment, Bad Lauchstädt (Chernozem), from treatments of farmyard manure (FYM), mineral fertilizer (NPK), their combination (FYM + NPK) and control without fertilizer inputs; (ii) Kraichgau; and (iii) Swabian Alb (Cambisols) areas, Southwest Germany. The two latter soils were further fractionated into particulate organic matter (POM), sand and stable aggregates (Sa + \emph{A}), silt and clay (Si + C), and NaOCl oxidized Si + C (rSOC) to gain OM of different inferred stabilities; respiration was measured from fresh soil samples incubated at 20 °C and 50\% water holding capacity for 490 days. A variable long path length gas cell was used to record the mid-infrared absorbance intensity of CO\textsubscript{2} (2400 to 2200 cm\textsuperscript{−1}) being evolved during soil heating from 25 to 700 °C with a heating rate of 68 °C min\textsuperscript{−1} and holding time of 10 min at 700 °C. Separately, the heating chamber was placed in a diffuse reflectance chamber (DRIFTS) for measuring the mid-infrared absorbance of the soil sample during heating. Thermal stability of the bulk soils and fractions was measured via the temperature of maximum CO\textsubscript{2} evolution (CO\textsubscript{2}\textsubscript{max}). {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} Results indicated that the FYM + NPK and FYM treatments of the Chernozem soils had a lower CO\textsubscript{2}\textsubscript{max} as compared to both NPK and CON treatments. On average, CO\textsubscript{2}\textsubscript{max} of the Chernozem was much higher (447 °C) as compared to the Cambisol sites (Kraichgau 392 °C; Swabian Alb 384 °C). The POM fraction had the highest CO\textsubscript{2}\textsubscript{max} (477 °C), while rSOC had a first peak at 265 °C at both sites and a second peak at 392 °C for the Swabian Alb and 482 °C for the Kraichgau. The CO\textsubscript{2}\textsubscript{max} increased after 490 day incubation, while the C lost during incubation was derived from the whole temperature range but a relatively higher proportion from 200 to 350 °C. In situ\textsubscript{\emph{T}} DRIFTS measurements indicated decreases in vibrational intensities in the order of C-OH = unknown C vibration {$<$} C-H {$<$} −COO/C =C {$<$} C = C with increasing temperature, but interpretation of vibrational changes was complicated by changes in the spectra (i.e., overall vibrational intensity increased with temperature increase) of the sample during heating. The relative quality changes and corresponding temperatures shown by the in situ\textsubscript{\emph{T}} DRIFTS measurements enabled the fitting of four components or peaks to the evolved CO\textsubscript{2} thermogram from the FTIR-EGA measurements. This gave a semi-quantitative measure of the quality of evolved C during the heating experiment, lending more evidence that different qualities of SOM are being evolved at different temperatures from 200 to 700 °C. The CO\textsubscript{2}\textsubscript{max} was influenced by long-term FYM input and also after 490 days of laboratory incubation, indicating that this measurement is an indicator for the relative overall SOM stability. The combination of FTIR-EGA and in situ\textsubscript{\emph{T}} DRIFTS allows for a quantitative and qualitative monitoring of thermal reactions of SOM, revealing its relative stability, and provides a sound basis for a peak fitting procedure for assigning proportions of evolved CO\textsubscript{2} to different thermal stability components.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The project brought together nineteen participants, from Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Japan, Morocco, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States of America and Vietnam, involved in the use of nuclear techniques and, more particularly, fallout radionuclides (FRN) to assess the relative impacts of different soil conservation measures on soil erosion and land productivity. The overall objective of the CRP was to develop improved land use and management strategies for sustainable watershed management through effective soil erosion control practices, by the use of ¹³⁷Cs (half-life of 30.2 years), ²¹⁰Pb(ex) (half-life of 22.3 years) and ⁷Be (half-life of 53.4 days) for measuring soil erosion over several spatial and temporal scales. The environmental conditions under which the different research teams applied the tools based on the use of fallout radionuclides varied considerably–a variety of climates, soils, topographies and land uses. Nevertheless, the achievements of the CRP, as reflected in this overview paper, demonstrate that fallout radionuclide-based techniques are powerful tools to assess soil erosion/deposition at several spatial and temporal scales in a wide range of environments, and offer potential to monitor soil quality. The success of the CRP has stimulated an interest in many IAEA Member States in the use of these methodologies to identify factors and practices that can enhance sustainable agriculture and minimize land degradation.},

The predictive quality of 12 published PTFs was evaluated using an independent dataset of forest soils (1614 samples) from Flanders, Belgium. For all samples, PTF accuracy and precision was calculated, and for topsoil and subsoil samples separately. All functions were found to produce a systematic underestimation of predicted \&\#929b, with mean prediction errors (MPEs) ranging between -0.01 and -0.51 Mg m-3. Most PTFs performed differently when applied to topsoil or subsoil data. Prediction of topsoil \&\#929b showed the highest prediction error. The evaluation demonstrated the poor performance of some published PTFs, and raised concern that the predictive ability of even the better models may not be adequate. Therefore, two candidate PTFs were recalibrated and validated. With recalibration, accuracy improved considerably and showed a near-zero bias, but precision increased only slightly. The best fitted empirical model was based on loss-on-ignition (1,01): \&\#929b = 1.775 - 0.173(LOI)1/2. Its predictive capacity was not significantly better than the Adams physical two-component model \&\#929b = 100/((LOI/0.312) + [(100 - LOI)/1.661]). For the prediction of \&\#929b in forest soils, LOI was two times more important than texture variables, and LOI alone accounted for {$>$} 55\% of the total variation. The lowest root mean squared prediction error (RMSPE) was 0.16 Mg m-3 for LOI-based, and 0.21 Mg m-3 for texture-based models.

Inmost soils, larger values of S are consistent with the presence of a better-defined microstructure. Much previous work has shown that this microstructure is responsible for most of the soil physical properties that are necessary for the proper functioning of soil in agriculture and the enviromnent. The use of S is illustrated with examples of soils with different texture, density (or degree of compaction), and organic matter (OM) content. The effects of S on root growth in soil are investigated, and S is shown to be a better indicator of soil rootability than bulk density. It is suggested that S can be used as an index of soil physical quality that enables different soils and the effects of different management treatments and conditions to be compared directly},

  abstract = {The international 4 per 1000 initiative aims at supporting states and non-governmental stakeholders in their efforts towards a better management of soil carbon (C) stocks. These stocks depend on soil C inputs and outputs. They are the result of fine spatial scale interconnected mechanisms, which stabilise/destabilise organic matter-borne C. Since 2016, the CarboSMSconsortium federates French researchers working on these mechanisms and their effects on C stocks in a local and global change setting (land use, agricultural prac- tices, climatic and soil conditions, etc.). This article is a syn- thesis of this consortium's first seminar. In the first part, we present recent advances in the understanding of soil C stabilisation mechanisms comprising biotic and abiotic pro- cesses, which occur concomitantly and interact. Soil organic C stocks are altered by biotic activities of plants (the main source of C through litter and root systems), microorganisms (fungi and bacteria) and ‘ecosystem engineers' (earthworms, termites, ants). In the meantime, abiotic processes related to the soil-physical structure, porosity and mineral fraction also modify these stocks. In the second part, we show how agri- cultural practices affect soil C stocks. By acting on both biotic and abiotic mechanisms, land use and management practices (choice of plant species and density, plant residue exports, amendments, fertilisation, tillage, etc.) drive soil spatiotempo- ral organic inputs and organic matter sensitivity to mineralisation. Interaction between the different mechanisms and their effects on C stocks are revealed by meta-analyses and long-termfield studies. The third part addresses upscaling issues. This is a cause for major concern since soil organic C stabilisation mechanisms are most often studied at fine spatial scales (mm–μm) under controlled conditions, while agricul- tural practices are implemented at the plot scale. We discuss some proxies and models describing specific mechanisms and their action in different soil and climatic contexts and show how they should be taken into account in large scale models, to improve change predictions in soil C stocks. Finally, this literature review highlights some future research prospects geared towards preserving or even increasing C stocks, our focus being put on the mechanisms, the effects of agricultural practices on them and C stock prediction models.},

  abstract = {Scope: Biochemistry is an essential yet undervalued aspect of soil ecology, especially when analyzing soil C cycling. We assume, based on tradition, intuition or hope, that the complexity of biochemistry is confined to the microscopic world, and can be ignored when dealing with whole soil systems. This opinion paper draws attention to patterns caused by basic biochemical processes that permeate the world of ecosystem processes. From these patterns, we can estimate activities of the biochemical reactions of the central C metabolic network and gain insights into the ecophysiology of microbial biosynthesis, growth, and maintenance energy requirements: important components of Carbon Use Efficiency (CUE). Observations: We show that glucose is processed via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas glycolysis in one soil, but via Pentose Phosphate or Entner-Doudoroff pathways in two other soils. However, notwithstanding this metabolic diversity, glucose use efficiency is high and thus substrate use for maintenance energy and overflow respiration is low in these soils. These results contradict current dogma, based on four decades of debate in soil ecology, that the maintenance energy demand in soil communities is a quantitative important, although variable, component of soil community energy metabolism. Conclusions: We identify three main shortcomings in our current understanding of substrate use efficiency: 1) in numeric and conceptual models, we lack appreciation of the strategies that microbes employ to quickly reduce energy needs in response to starvation; 2) in order to understand variation in CUE, we need to improve our understanding of the processes of exudation (including all changes in allocation of C from the cell soluble to insoluble fraction and extracellular environment) and microbial turnover; and 3) whether tracer experiments can be used to measure the long-term substrate use efficiency of soil microbial communities depends critically on the ability and speed with which non-growing cells take up tracer substrates and metabolism activates and subsequently de-activates in response to starvation, as well as on how cellular activities scale to the community level. To move the field of soil ecology forward, future research must consider the details of microbial ecophysiology and develop new tools that enable direct measurement of microbial functioning in intact soils. We submit that 13C metabolic flux analysis is one of those new tools.},

Both substrate-induced respiration rate and RQ value increased with increasing glucose concentration. Glucose plus nitrate addition gave the highest RQ value in the agricultural soil whereas addition of glucose alone gave the highest RQ value in the forest soil. Generally, glucose plus ammonium addition resulted in lower RQ values than glucose addition alone. When glucose was added to soil at field rates of C input, the RQ value showed fluctuations between 0.44 and 1.35. Low C supply caused rapid return of the initially enhanced RQ value towards those of basal respiration, that was typically {$<$}1. The experiment showed that both respiratory activity and respiratory quotient increased with increasing amount of available C. The RQ values {$>$}1 refer to both anabolic C uptake and 'unbalanced' C degradation.

  abstract = {Developing a better understanding of the processes involved in controlling soil carbon (C) storage and turnover in native forest soils is critical if we are to fully understand the role land management activities play in the global C cycle. Separating soil organic matter (SOM) into discrete fractions has been successfully used to isolate changes in the structure and function of the SOM pool in response to land management activities but investigations in native forest systems are rare. Using a density fractionation procedure, we isolated and characterized three distinct SOM fractions (free, intra-aggregate, and organo-mineral) across a postharvest forest age sequence. We describe age related variations in each of these fractions with respect to their contribution to soil mass, C storage, C concentrations, C-to-N ratios, and δ 13C ratios. In conceptual models of SOM pool structure, the organo-mineral fraction is assumed to be largely stable. We show that harvesting may increase the potential for loss of soil C (i.e., destabilize the soil C pool) and that a significant portion of the soil C pool may be cycling on decadal timescales. Isotopic evidence is consistent with a period of C loss attributable to increased rates of decomposition, with losses below 20 cm driving the trend. We encourage investigators studying the effects of forest harvesting on SOM storage to consider the deeper mineral soil (20+ cm) and how we may increase SOM turnover time and stabilization capacity in a native forest system.},

  abstract = {Chemical weathering in soils dissolves and alters minerals, mobilizes metals, liberates nutrients to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and may modulate Earth's climate over geologic time scales. Climate-weathering relationships are often considered fundamental controls on the evolution of Earth's surface and biogeochemical cycles. However, surprisingly little consensus has emerged on if and how climate controls chemical weathering, and models and data from published literature often give contrasting correlations and predictions for how weathering rates and climate variables such as temperature or moisture are related. Here we combine insights gained from the different approaches, methods, and theory of the soil science, biogeochemistry, and geomorphology communities to tackle the fundamental question of how rainfall influences soil chemical properties. We explore climate-driven variations in weathering and soil development in young, postglacial soils of New Zealand, measuring soil elemental geochemistry along a large precipitation gradient (400–4700 mm/yr) across the Waitaki basin on Te Waipounamu, the South Island. Our data show a strong climate imprint on chemical weathering in these young soils. This climate control is evidenced by rapid nonlinear changes along the gradient in total and exchangeable cations in soils and in the increased movement and redistribution of metals with rainfall. The nonlinear behavior provides insight into why climate-weathering relationships may be elusive in some landscapes. These weathering thresholds also have significant implications for how climate may influence landscape evolution and the release of rock-derived nutrients to ecosystems, as landscapes that transition to wetter climates across this threshold may weather and deplete rapidly.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have highlighted the tight coupling between geomorphic processes and soil carbon (C) turnover and suggested that eroding landscapes can stabilize more C than their non-eroding counterparts. However, large uncer- tainties remain and a mechanistic understanding of geomorphic effects on C storage in soils is still lacking. Here, we quantified the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock and pool distribution along geomorphic gradients and combined data derived from soil organic matter fractionation and incubation experiments. The size and composition of the SOC pools were strongly related to geomorphic position: 1.6 to 6.2 times more C was stabilized in the subsoils (25–100cm) of depositional profiles than in those of eroding profiles. Subsoil C of depositional profiles is predominantly asso- ciated with microaggregates and silt-sized particles which are associated with pools of intermediate stability. We observed a significantly higher mean residence time for the fast and intermediate turnover pools of buried C at depositional positions, relative to non-eroding and eroding positions, resulting from the physical protection of C associated with microaggregates and silt particles. Conversely, significant amounts of C were replaced at eroding positions but the lower degree of decomposition and the lack of physically protected C, resulted in higher respiration rates. By considering C cycling at non-eroding, eroding and depositional positions, we found that the eroding land- scapes studied store up to 10\% more C due to soil redistribution processes than non-eroding landscapes. This is the result of the stabilization of C in former subsoil at eroding positions and partial preservation of buried C in pools of intermediate turnover at depositional positions. However, the sink strength was limited by significant losses of buried C as only a small fraction of the C was associated with stable pools.},

Climate is generally regarded as one of the primary controls over soil organic carbon, but there is still uncertainty about the direction and magnitude of carbon responses to climate change.

We find that soils with high carbon content are characterized by substantial adsorption of carbon compounds onto mineral soil and low rates of respiration per unit of soil carbon; and vice versa for soils with low carbon content. Precipitation and temperature were only secondary predictors for carbon storage, respiration, residence time and stabilization mechanisms. Correlations between climatic variables and carbon variables decreased significantly after removing relationships with geochemical predictors. We conclude that the interactions of climatic and geochemical factors control soil organic carbon storage and turnover, and must be considered for robust prediction of current and future soil carbon storage.},

DOC fluxes and their controlling factors were investigated on two grassland sites with similar climatic conditions but different soil types (Vertisol vs. Arenosol) for a 2.5-year period. Parts of both grasslands were disturbed by deep ploughing during afforestation. Contrary to what was expected, ploughing did not increase DOC export but surface soil DOC concentrations decreased by 28\% (Vertisol) and 14\% (Arenosol). DOC flux from the soil profile was negatively influences by the clay content of the soil with seven times larger DOC export in the clay-poor Arenosol (55 kg C ha(-1) a(-1)) than in the clay-rich Vertisol (8 kg C ha(-1) a(-1)). At the Arenosol site, highest DOC concentrations were measured in late summer, whereas in the Vertisol there was a time lag of several months between surface and subsoil DOC with highest subsoil DOC concentrations during winter season. DOC export was not correlated with soil organic carbon stocks. Large differences in C-14 concentrations of 22-40 pMC between soil organic carbon and DOC in the subsoil indicated that both C pools are largely decoupled. We conclude that DOC export at both sites is not controlled by the vegetation but by physicochemical parameters such as the adsorption capacity of soil minerals and the water balance of the ecosystem. Only in the acidic sandy Arenosol DOC export was a significant C flux of about 8\% of net ecosystem production.},

  abstract = {Quantification of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks is quite useful for accurate monitoring of C sequestration. However, there are still substantial gaps in our knowledge of SOC stocks in many parts of the world, including the Himalayas. We investigated the total SOC stocks and its spatial distribution under different land use and land cover (LULC) types in montane ecosystems of Bhutan. 186 Soil profiles were described and sampled by genetic horizons at sites located using conditioned Latin hypercube sampling. SOC concentrations at the standard depths designated for the GlobalSoilMap.Net were estimated with an equal-area spline profile function. SOC concentrations at these depth intervals were digitally mapped to a fine resolution matrix of 90m grid using regression kriging. We found significant influence of LULC categories on SOC concentration, SOC density, SOC stocks and their spatial distributions, although this influence decreased with increasing soil depth. The estimated mean SOC density in the top 1m were highest in fir forest soils (41.4kgm−2) and lowest in paddy land (12.0kgm−2). Allowing for LULC relative areas, mixed conifer forest had the highest SOC stocks in the upper meter (12.4Mt) with orchards the lowest (0.1Mt). The total SOC stocks for the whole study area for the 0–5, 5–15, 15–30, 30–60 and 60–100cm depths were 2.6, 5.0, 6.5, 7.5 and 5.4Mt, respectively. The overall SOC stock of the study area for the upper meter was approximately 27.1Mt. The combined forests accounted for more than 77.5\% of the total SOC stocks of the study area. This and the relative SOC densities indicate that the conversion of even a fraction of forests to other LULC types could lead to substantial loss of SOC stocks. This loss of SOC stock is even greater when the decrease in aboveground biomass is also taken into consideration. However, appropriate management of the agricultural lands could increase their sequestration of atmospheric CO2.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Summer droughts in the western United States are expected to intensify with climate change. Thus, an adequate representation of ecosystem drought response in land models is critical for predicting carbon dynamics. The goal of this study was to assess the performance of the Community Land Model, Version 4.5 (CLM) for an old-growth coniferous forest in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States (Wind River AmeriFlux site), characterized by a climate that has heavy winter precipitation followed by summer drought. Particular attention was given to the model skill in the simulation of stomatal conductance and its response to drought stress. CLM was driven by site-observed meteorology and calibrated primarily using parameter values observed at the site or at similar stands in the region. Key model adjustments included parameters controlling specific leaf area and stomatal conductance. Default values of these parameters led to significant underestimation of gross primary production, overestimation of evapotranspiration, and consequently overestimation of photosynthetic \textsuperscript{13}C discrimination, reflected on reduced \textsuperscript{13}C:\textsuperscript{12}C ratios of carbon fluxes and pools. Adjustments in soil hydraulic parameters within CLM were also critical, preventing significant underestimation of soil water content and unrealistic drought stress during summer. After calibration, CLM was able to simulate energy and carbon fluxes, leaf area index, biomass stocks, and carbon isotope ratios of carbon fluxes and pools in reasonable agreement with site observations. Overall, the calibrated CLM was able to simulate the observed response of canopy conductance to atmospheric vapor pressure deficit and soil water content, reasonably capturing the impact of drought stress on ecosystem functioning. The calibrated parameters may be of use for future modeling studies involving stands of similar age and composition under a similar climate regime. More broadly, the calibration of the Ball-Berry stomatal conductance model in CLM aligned with observations reported in the literature for coniferous trees, suggesting that a future release of CLM would benefit from using a distinct, lower slope value (\emph{m}\textsubscript{\emph{bb}}=6) for conifers, rather than a unique value for all C3 plants (\emph{m}\textsubscript{\emph{bb}}=9). Thanks to the recent implementation of photosynthetic 13C discrimination within CLM, the results of this study indicate that carbon isotope measurements can be used to constrain stomatal conductance and water use efficiency in CLM as an alternative to flux observations. They also have the potential to guide structural improvements in the model in respect to the representation of carbon storage pools.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The poorly crystalline Fe (hydr)oxide (Feo) and OC contents are significantly correlated with WSA in the A horizons (r2 = 0.95, n = 6, p = 0.001, and r2 = 0.93, n = 6, p = 0.002, respectively) and in the B horizons (r2 = 0.73, n = 6, p = 0.029, and r2 = 0.76, n = 6, p = 0.024, respectively). When regressed against MWD, Feo has an r2 of 0.89 (n = 6, p = 0.004) in the A, and 0.97 (n = 6, p = 0.000) in the B horizons. The coefficient of determination of MWD vs. OC contents is 0.98 (n = 6, p = 0.000) in the A and 0.79 (n = 6, p = 0.018) in the B horizons. Clay and Fed contents are not significantly correlated to WSA or MWD. Apparently, the Feo component (poorly crystalline) is more effective than Fed at stabilizing soil aggregates, even though it is present in lower concentrations. The Feo component appears more important than OC in terms of WSA and MWD for soils with relatively low soil organic matter contents.},

  abstract = {Soils in the highlands of north-eastern Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil) show dark-coloured topsoils which are light and very rich in organic matter. They are distributed in a mosaic of grassland, forest with Araucaria angustifolia and several anthropogenic vegetation forms. The climate is humid and temperate without marked dry periods. We characterized and classified 27 soils to investigate the relationships between present and past vegetation pattern and soil properties. All soils are strongly acidic with high clay contents, low bulk densities and most of them show high phosphate retentions. X-ray diffraction indicates the presence of quartz, kaolinite, secondary chlorite and gibbsite. Selective extractions with pyrophosphate (p), dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate (d) and acid oxalate (o) give in most horizons the following relationships: Fed {$>$} Fep {$>$} Feo and Alp {$>$} Ald {$>$} Alo. Despite the possible Al release from gibbsite, we attribute the high Alp concentrations mainly to high amounts of Al-humus complexes. The absence of allophane and imogolite was confirmed by the very low Sio and Sid concentrations. 21 soils have andic properties according to World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) [IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006. World Reference Base for Soil Resources 2006. World Soil Resources Reports, 103. FAO, Rome.] at least for some depth range, 15 of them fulfil the minimum thickness and depth requirements of Andosols. They belong to the aluandic type and are the first detected Andosols in South America outside the areas of recent volcanism in the Andes. The other soils are Umbrisols (11) and Cambisols (1). In grassland soils, andic properties start at or near the soil surface, in forest soils they are only present in subsurface layers, especially in buried A horizons. The latter differ from their actual topsoils by some characteristics which they have in common with the grassland soils like deep black colours and low melanic indexes. It is known from pollen analyses that the Araucaria forests are invading the grasslands since about 1000 years. In this environment a grass vegetation seems to favour formation and permanence of Andosols whereas a change into the forest starts a process of losing andic properties. Most soils without andic properties or with andic properties of insufficient thickness only fail the required minimum concentrations of Alo and Feo. On the other hand, they all show similar concentrations of Ald and Fed. Therefore we conclude that the loss of andic properties with forest proliferation is caused by crystallization of Al and Fe oxides which seems to be easier under forest. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Mechanisms to mitigate global climate change by sequestering carbon (C) in different ‘sinks' have been proposed as at least temporary measures. Of the major global C pools, terrestrial ecosystems hold the potential to capture and store substantially increased volumes of C in soil organic matter (SOM) through changes in management that are also of benefit to the multitude of ecosystem services that soils provide. This potential can only be realized by determining the amount of SOM stored in soils now, with subsequent quantification of how this is affected by management strate- gies intended to increase SOM concentrations, and used in soil C models for the prediction of the roles of soils in future climate change. An apparently obvious method to increase C stocks in soils is to augment the soil C pools with the longest mean residence times (MRT). Computer simulation models of soil C dynamics, e.g. RothC and Century, partition these refractory constituents into slow and passive pools with MRTs of centuries to millennia. This partition- ing is assumed to reflect: (i) the average biomolecular properties of SOM in the pools with reference to their source in plant litter, (ii) the accessibility of the SOM to decomposer organisms or catalytic enzymes, or (iii) constraints imposed on decomposition by environmental conditions, including soil moisture and temperature. However, con- temporary analytical approaches suggest that the chemical composition of these pools is not necessarily predictable because, despite considerable progress with understanding decomposition processes and the role of decomposer organisms, along with refinements in simulation models, little progress has been made in reconciling biochemical properties with the kinetically defined pools. In this review, we will explore how advances in quantitative analytical techniques have redefined the new understanding of SOM dynamics and how this is affecting the development and application of new modelling approaches to soil C},

To test this hypothesis, we enhanced and applied a model (Biotic and Abiotic Model of SOM – BAMS1) that represents microbial dynamics and organo-mineral interactions integrated with a multiphase reactive transport solver for variably saturated porous media. The model represents aqueous chemistry, aqueous advection and diffusion, gaseous diffusion, sorption processes, bacterial and fungal activity, and archetypal monomer- and polymer-carbon substrate groups, including dead cell wall material. This model structure is fundamentally different, and produces different SOM dynamics, than the pseudo-first order relationships that are used in most site- and global-scale terrestrial SOM models. We simulated two grasslands, a seven-site chronosequence (∼3.9–240 Ky) in Northern California, and a Russian Chernozem site where soils were sampled 100 years apart. We calibrated the model's vertically-resolved soil bulk specific surface area (SBSSA) using observed bulk SOM content, and then tested the model against observed Δ14C profiles. The modeled microbial processes, organo-mineral interactions, and vertical aqueous transport produced realistic vertically-resolved predictions of bulk SOM content, Δ14C values of SOM, lignin content, and fungi-to-aerobic bacteria biomass ratios. Using sensitivity analyses, we found that vertical carbon input profiles were important controls over the Δ14C depth distribution. Shallower carbon input profiles lead to older carbon at depth. In addition, the SBSSA was the dominant control over the magnitude and vertical distribution of SOM stocks. The findings of this study demonstrate the value of explicitly incorporating microbial activity, sorption, and vertical transport into land models to predict SOM dynamics.},

The educational dimension employs Bloom's revised taxonomy to define learning objectives and applies the classroom multiplayer presential game (CMPG) pedagogical model while the ludic dimension determines the gaming elements subject to constraints imposed by the educational dimension. With a view to validating the framework, a game for teaching electrostatics was designed and experimentally implemented in a classroom context. An evaluation based on pre/post testing found that the game increased the average number of correct answers by students participating in the experiment from 6.11 to 10.00, a result found to be statistically significant.

  abstract = {Interactions between climate and soil remain ambiguous, particularly when silicate weathering and clay mineral formation and transformation rates are considered in relation to global climate changes. Recent studies suggest that climate affects weathering rates much less than previously thought. Here we show that the climate in the central European Alps has a significant, but indirect, influence on the weathering of soils through vegetation. The pattern of element leaching and mineral transformations is not only due to precipitation and temperature. Element leaching was greatest in subalpine forests near the timberline; weathering is lessened at higher and lower altitudes. Vegetation, therefore, contributes significantly to weathering processes. The highest accumulation of organic matter was found in climatically cooler sites (subalpine range) where the production of organic ligands, which enhance weathering, is greatest. Patterns of smectite formation and distribution had strong similarities to that of the elemental losses of Fe and Al (R = 0.69; P {$<$} 0.01) or base cations (R = 0.58; P {$<$} 0.05). Higher precipitation rates and the production of organic chelating compounds in the soil promoted the appearance of smectites. The relationship between climate, element leaching (Fe, Al, Ca, Mg, K, Na), and smectite formation is strongly nonlinear and driven by the podzolisation process, which is more pronounced near the timberline because of the bioclimatic constellation. Climate warming will probably, in the future, lead to a decrease in SOM stocks in the subalpine to alpine range because of more favourable conditions for biodegradation that would also affect weathering processes. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The main aim of this study was to examine the influence of exposure and consequently climate, on the chemical weathering of soils which had developed after the ice retreat of the last glaciation in Northern Italy. This was done by comparing soils developing at north- and south-facing sites on siliceous parent material. There is very little data available on weathering rates and organic matter (OM) as a function of climate and exposure in such environments. Weathering rates (elemental leaching) over the whole lifetime of the soils are higher on north-facing sites. Total organic C and N contents, organic matter stocks and organic matter fractions were analysed to decipher the causes of this difference in weathering behaviour. For the organic matter fractions, we compared the easily oxidisable and stable (resistant to H2O2 treatment) organic matter fractions, water-soluble phenolic materials and alkaline-extractable fractions of the various sites. The abundance of soil organic carbon (SOC) tends to have a non-linear climate dependency. The highest amounts of SOC were measured near the timberline. In addition, compared to south-facing sites, soils on north-facing slopes have a higher organic matter content and a significantly lower degree of humification. Undecomposed or weakly degraded organic matter accumulated on north-facing sites due to less favourable thermal conditions and a higher acidity. With northern exposure, fulvic acids were more easily transported within the soil profile than humic acids and predominately gave rise to the migration (eluviation) of Fe and Al compounds due to their -COOH and -OH functional groups. Furthermore, water-soluble phenolic materials, which are more abundant on north-facing sites, have accelerated the leaching of Al. Accumulation of weakly degraded OM and the subsequently higher production of organic ligands have enhanced the eluviation of Fe and Al. Patterns of weathering processes in Alpine environments are strongly linked to biological and (micro)climatic factors which give rise to distinct differences between north- and south-facing sites. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Using published and new chronosequence datasets from the European Alps and the Wind River Range (Rocky Mountains, USA), we report for the first time a chronosequence of more than 1Ma for soil organic carbon, nitrogen and organic matter (SOM) fractions from alpine soils. The investigated parameters include total carbon and nitrogen as well as the stable (resistant to H 2O 2 oxidation) C and N fractions. Time trends were analysed and are reported on the basis of stocks and concentrations. The accumulation rates of C and N strongly decreased with increasing soil age. Differences in trends between the European Alps and the Wind River Range might be attributed to the factor climate. For the drier Wind River Range, an asymptotic value of about 15kgC m -2 was reached after about 15ky while an asymptotic value of 20-25kgC m -2 was measured for the moister European Alps after about 3ky. The difference in N stocks between the two regions was less obvious. For both areas, N was in the range of 0.5-2kgN m -2. Using the exponential decay model, a steady state of C and N (stable and total) concentrations in the topsoil seemed to be reached after {$<$}1ky (Alps) and 10ky (Wind River Range). The retardation effect observed for the Wind River Range could probably be due to aeolian influx. For both areas, the asymptotic value of the stable fraction of C and N was in the range of 1-3kgC m -2 and 0.2-0.4kgN m -2, respectively. The stable organic fraction often has an age close to the age of the soils and consequently can reach thousands of years. The relative proportion of N and amides was higher in the stable organic fraction compared to the bulk soil. The sequestration rates of org. C and N in soils of the European Alps and the Wind River Range can reach very high values in very young soils whereas in old soils sequestration rates are several orders of magnitude lower. Old soils often integrate several cold and warm phases and different vegetation types. Nonetheless, the factor Time seems to be very dominant and covers the track of other factors in old soils. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Recent modeling and comparison with field results showed that soil formation by chemical weathering, from bedrock or unconsolidated material, is limited largely by solute transport. Chemical weathering rates are proportional to solute velocities. Nonreactive solute transport described by non-Gaussian transport theory appears compatible with soil formation rates. This change in understanding opens new possibilities for predicting soil production and depth across orders of magnitude of time scales. Percolation theory for modeling the evolution of soil depth and production was applied to new and published data for alpine and Mediterranean soils. The first goal was to check whether the empirical data conform to the theory. Secondly we analyzed discrepancies between theory and observation to find out if the theory is incomplete, if modifications of existing experimental procedures are needed and what parameters might be estimated improperly. Not all input parameters required for current theoretical formulations (particle size, erosion and infiltration rates) are collected routinely in the field; thus, theory must address how to find these quantities from existing climate and soil data repositories, which implicitly introduces some uncertainties. Existing results for soil texture, typically reported at relevant field sites, had to be transformed to results for a median particle size, d50, a specific theoretical input parameter. The modeling tracked reasonably well the evolution of the alpine and Mediterranean soils. For the Alpine sites we found, however, that we consistently overestimated soil depths by approximately 45\%. Particularly during early soil formation, chemical weathering is more severely limited by reaction kinetics than by solute transport. The kinetic limitation of mineral weathering can affect the system until 1kyr to a maximum of 10kyr of soil evolution. Thereafter, solute transport seems dominant. The trend and scatter of soil depth evolution is well captured, particularly for Mediterranean soils. We assume that some neglected processes, such as bioturbation, tree throw, and land use change contributed to local reorganization of the soil and thus to some differences to the model. Nonetheless, the model is able to generate soil depth and confirms decreasing production rates with age. A steady state for soils is not reached before about 100 kyr.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial vegetation and soils hold three times more carbon than the atmosphere. Much debate concerns how anthropogenic activity will perturb these surface reservoirs, potentially exacerbating ongoing changes to the climate system. Uncertainties specifically persist in extrapolating point-source observations to ecosystem-scale budgets and fluxes, which require consideration of vertical and lateral processes on multiple temporal and spatial scales. To explore controls on organic carbon (OC) turnover at the river basin scale, we present radiocarbon (14C) ages on two groups of molecular tracers of plant-derived carbon—leaf-wax lipids and lignin phenols—from a globally distributed suite of rivers. We find significant negative relationships between the 14C age of these biomarkers and mean annual temperature and precipitation. Moreover, riverine biospheric-carbon ages scale proportionally with basin-wide soil carbon turnover times and soil 14C ages, implicating OC cycling within soils as a primary control on exported biomarker ages and revealing a broad distribution of soil OC reactivities. The ubiquitous occurrence of a long-lived soil OC pool suggests soil OC is globally vulnerable to perturbations by future temperature and precipitation increase. Scaling of riverine biospheric-carbon ages with soil OC turnover shows the former can constrain the sensitivity of carbon dynamics to environmental controls on broad spatial scales. Extracting this information from fluvially dominated sedimentary sequences may inform past variations in soil OC turnover in response to anthropogenic and/or climate perturbations. In turn, monitoring riverine OC composition may help detect future climate-change–induced perturbations of soil OC turnover and stocks.},

The biotic strategies discussed comprise well-known activities, such as the release of exo-enzymes, the mechanical crushing of organic residues, the bioturbation of soil mass, and the fixation of carbon in the living biomass. The ecological processes described have received less attention regarding their importance in prolonging the persistence of soil organic matter. Model calculations illustrate that cell energy demand forces micro-organisms to operate at low decomposition rates, and that diffusion losses inhibit microbial growth and impede the formation of new microbial colonies. The specialisation of decomposer organisms towards particular microhabitats and substrates gives rise to refuges where organic resources are temporarily not accessed. We derive four stability criteria, by which we classify organic matter pools: passive versus active stabilisation, and partial versus absolute refuge. Two case studies confirm that in temperate soils a dominant quantity of organic material resides in the passive stabilisation/partial refuge status and persists in spite of being accessible and decomposable. We conclude that soil organic matter is stabilised by a complex of mechanisms that constrain decomposition rates, several of which are not based on substrate quality or soil conditions, but on the biology of the decomposing soil organisms. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {We review recent experimental results on the role of soil biota in stabilizing or destabilizing soil organic matter (SOM). Specifically, we analyze how the differential substrate utilization of the various decomposer organisms contributes to a decorrelation of chemical stability, residence time, and carbon (C) age of organic substrates.. Along soil depth profiles, a mismatch of C allocation and abundance of decomposer organisms is consistently observed, revealing that a relevant proportion of soil C is not subjected to efficient decomposition. Results from recent field and laboratory experiments suggest that (1) bacterial utilization of labile carbon compounds is limited by short-distance transport processes and, therefore, can take place deep in the soil under conditions of effective local diffusion or convection . In contrast, (2) fungal utilization of phenolic substrates, including lignin, appears to be restricted to the upper soil layer due to the requirement for oxygen of the enzymatic reaction involved. (3) Carbon of any age is utilized by soil microorganisms, and microbial C is recycled in the microbial food web. Due to stoichiometric requirements of their metabolism, (4) soil animals tend to reduce the C concentration of SOM disproportionally, until it reaches a threshold level. The reviewed investigations provide new and quantitative evidence that different soil C pools underlie divergent biological constraints of decomposition. The specialization of decomposers towards different substrates and microhabitats leads to a relatively longer persistence of virtually all kinds of organic substrates in the nonpreferred soil spaces. We therefore propose to direct future research explicitly towards such biologically nonpreferred areas where decomposition rates are slow, or where decomposition is frequently interrupted, in order to assess the potential for long-term preservation of C in the soil.},

  abstract = {Carbon turnover models are used to estimate changes in soil organic matter (SOM) content caused by management or land use. A limitation of most of these models is that their conceptual C-pools generally do not correspond to experimentally verifiable organic matter (OM) fractions. Our intention was to isolate OM fractions different in solubility and to identify their composition and their stability. The latter was done to find out if they could be used to evaluate the conceptual C-pools. NPK fertilized soils with maize and wheat cropping from two long-term field experiments (Halle and Rotthalmünster) were selected. Water (W) and sodium-pyrophosphate soluble (PYP) OM fractions were extracted sequentially from the soils using water in the first and 0.1 M sodium-pyrophosphate solution (pH=10) in the second step. The amounts of W and PYP fractions isolated from Rotthalmünster soils are somewhat lower than those obtained from Halle soils caused by higher Fe and Mn content in Rotthalmünster soil, which hinder the OM extraction. However, based on the natural abundance trace technique, for both sites, the PY P fraction was found to be older than the W fraction and hence to be more stable than W. Therefore, it could be assumed that sequential extraction seems to be useful to isolate OM fraction different in stability. PYp represents up to 40\% of total soil organic matter; therefore, it may be a useful tool to evaluate a stable C-pool in C turnover models. According to FTIR spectra of the isolated OM fractions (especially PYp), their composition was influenced by growing crop and site conditions. This is of importance as composition of OM is related to its sorption properties, which may be relevant for transport processes. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Site conditions and soil management determine the content and the composition of soil organic matter (SOM). Organic matter (OM) is characterized by functional groups, which preferentially interact with polyvalent cations and soil minerals. These interactions could perhaps explain the site-specific composition of bulk SOM and a pyrophosphate-soluble OM fraction (OM-PY) using basic soil properties. The objective of this study was to test a simplified model for the interactions between OM and polyvalent cations (i.e., Ca, Mg, Al, Fe, and Mn) by using data from soils from long-term field experiments. The model considered (1) OM–cation, (2) OM–cation-mineral, and (3) OM–mineral associations and assumed that the availability of the cation's coordination sites for the interaction with OM depends on these three types of associations. The test was carried out using data (topsoil) from differently fertilized plots from three long-term field experiments (Halle, Bad Lauchstädt, Rotthalmünster). The composition of SOM and OM-PY was characterized by the relationship of the ratio of the C=O (i.e., here indicating both carbonylic and carboxylic groups) versus C–O–C absorption band intensities obtained from the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra with the content of exchangeable, oxalate-, and dithionite-extractable polyvalent cations. The assumed associations between the OM and cations and the availability of the coordination sites explained most of the variations in the C=O/C–O–C ratios of the SOM, and fewer variations in the OM-PY, when using the site-specific exchangeable and oxalate-extractable cation contents. The C=O/C–O–C ratios of the OM-PY were site-independent for samples from plots that regularly received farmyard manure. The results suggested that a simplified model that considers the polyvalent cation content weighted by the number of coordination sites per cation according to the type of association could be used to improve the explanation of site-specific differences in the OM composition of arable soils.},

Chemical analyses in the laboratory indicate the concentrations of elements in soils, but the thickness and bulk density of the soil layers in the fieid must be considered to estimate the quantities of elements per unit area. Conventional methods that calculate organic matter storage as the product of concentration, bulk density and thickness do not fully account for variations in soil mass. Comparisons between the quantities of organic C, N, P and S in Gray Luvisol soils under native aspen forest and various cropping systems were hampered by differences in the mass of soil under consideration. The influence of these differences was eliminated by calculating the masses of C, N, P and S in an "equivalent soil mass" (i.e. the mass of soil in a standard or reference surface layer). Reassessment of previously published data also indicated that estimates of organic matter storage depended on soil mass. Appraisals of organic matter depletion or accumulation usually were different for cimparisons among element masses in an equivalent soil mass than for comparisons among element masses in genetic horizons or in fixed sampling depths. Unless soil erosion or deposition had altered the mass of topsoil per unit area, comparisons among unequal soil masses were unjustified and erroneous. For management-induced changes in soil organic matter and nutrient storage to be assessed reliably, the masses of soil being compared must be equivalent.},

We used particle-size fractions {$<$} 6.3 μm of two soils to examine the importance of Fe oxides, short-range order Al silicates and the surface areas of minerals and micropores on the formation of organo-mineral associations. In the subsoil Fe oxides were most strongly statistically correlated with the mineral-bound organic carbon. We therefore assume that they are the most important substrates for the formation of organo-mineral associations. There is no indication that this is caused by physical protection of organic matter in their micropores ({$<$} 2 nm). In the Haplic Podzol, dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate-soluble short-range order Al silicates may also play a role. Fe oxide particles were calculated to offer specific surface areas of ∼200m2g-1 (goethite) and ∼800m2g-1 (ferrihydrite), corresponding to crystal diameters of only a few nm. We assume that the resulting large amount of oxide-specific reactive surface sites (conditionally charged hydroxyl groups) is responsible for their dominant role as sorbents. With maximum C loadings of 1.3 mg C per m2 Fe oxide for the Dystric Cambisol and 1.1 mg C per m2 Fe oxide 4- short-range order Al silicates for the Haplic Podzol the subsoils of both soils seem to have reached saturation with respect to organic matter sorption. In contrast to subsoil horizons, organo-mineral associations from topsoils contain much larger amounts of organic matter. Here a larger C loading on Fe oxides or a greater importance of other sorbents in addition to the oxides must be assumed. © 2005 British Society of Soil Science.}

The radiocarbon content of SOC from surfaces and interiors of large-scale soil structural units (peds) was measured in order to characterize the spatial distribution of soil C pools with distinct residence times. The radiocarbon content of CO2 released following sieving was used to identify the C that is readily respired upon physical disturbance of soil structure. We found the longest SOC residence times in the interiors of peds from subsurface B horizons, where limited bioturbation leads to stable large-scale structure. The radiocarbon value of this interior SOC (?14C = -555) indicates that this pool has been protected from decomposition for thousands of years. Similarly ancient C (?14C = -596) was released upon physical disruption of subsurface B horizons from a similar soil, indicating that this SOC was old, but chemically labile. With cultivation, the C released upon physical disruption of B horizons was even older (?14C = -812) than in the uncultivated soil. In uncultivated A horizons, which are subject to continuous bioturbation, large-scale structure resulted in contrasting SOC pools only in the surface horizon, where bomb C effects are strong. A horizon incubations also suggested effects of smaller-scale structure.

  abstract = {To examine the mechanisms of earthworm effects on forest soil C and N, we double-labeled leaf litter with 13C and 15N, applied it to sugar maple forest plots with and without earthworms, and traced isotopes into soil pools. The experimental design included forest plots with different earthworm community composition (dominated by Lumbricus terrestris or L. rubellus). Soil carbon pools were 37\% lower in earthworm-invaded plots largely because of the elimination of the forest floor horizons, and mineral soil C:N was lower in earthworm plots despite the mixing of high C:N organic matter into soil by earthworms. Litter disappearance over the first winter-spring was highest in the L. terrestris (T) plots, but during the warm season, rapid loss of litter was observed in both L. rubellus (R) and T plots. After two years, 22.0\% +/- 5.4\% of 13C released from litter was recovered in soil with no significant differences among plots. Total recovery of added 13C (decaying litter plus soil) was much higher in no-worm (NW) plots (61-68\%) than in R and T plots (20-29\%) as much of the litter remained in the former whereas it had disappeared in the latter. Much higher percentage recovery of 15N than 13C was observed, with significantly lower values for T than R and NW plots. Higher overwinter earthworm activity in T plots contributed to lower soil N recovery. In earthworm-invaded plots isotope enrichment was highest in macroaggregates and microaggregates whereas in NW plots silt plus clay fractions were most enriched. The net effect of litter mixing and priming of recalcitrant soil organic matter (SOM), stabilization of SOM in soil aggregates, and alteration of the soil microbial community by earthworm activity results in loss of SOM and lowering of the C:N ratio. We suggest that earthworm stoichiometry plays a fundamental role in regulating C and N dynamics of forest SOM.},

Exotic earthworm invasion of northern forest soils in North America can affect soil C pools, and we examined their effects on these mechanisms by adding C-13 labeled leaf litter to adjacent northern hardwood forests with and without earthworms. Two types of labeled litter were produced, one with the C-13 more concentrated in structural (S) components and the other in non-structural (NS) components, to evaluate the role of biochemical differences in soil C stabilization. Earthworm invasions have reduced soil C storage in the upper 20 cm of the soil profile by 37 \%, mostly by eliminating surface organic horizons. Despite rapid mixing of litter into mineral soil and its incorporation into aggregates, mineral soil C has not increased in the presence of earthworms. Incorporation of litter C into soil and microbial biomass was not affected by biochemical differences between S versus NS labeled litter although NS litter C was assimilated more readily into earthworm biomass and S litter C into fungal hyphae. Apparently, the net effect of earthworm mixing of litter and forest floor C into mineral soil, plus stabilization of that C in aggregates, is counterbalanced by earthworm bioturbation and possible priming effects. Our results support recent arguments that biochemical recalcitrance is not a major contributor to the stabilization of soil C.},

Evapora- tion of soil water was less and soil temperatures were higher under gravel mulch as compared with a bare soil surface. Increased crop yield on the gravel-mulch treat- ment appeared to be due to an interaction of more soil water and higher soil temperature. Bare soil strips for crop rows and annual regeneration of the gravel mulch were necessary management practices to permit both crop production and maintenance of an effective mulch. The study has indicated that gravel mulch not only promotes increased crop yields but also has a potential for mecha- nized application and maintenance.},

A slight linear decrease between the root mass: length distribution ratio and the soil depth was found for monocotyledons while an exponential decrease with depth was found for dicotyledons. These results indicated that roots were thicker at upper soil layers with the effect much larger for dicotyledons. The estimated depth at which 50\% of total root was accumulated for different crops varied from 8 cm to 20 cm. Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) showed the deepest rooting profile with a fitted maximum rooting depth (dmax) of 177 cm but another perennial, fescue (Festuca arundinacea Shreb.), had the shallowest dmax of 78 cm. In general, cereal and pulse crop roots were distributed more evenly in soil profile while more roots were accumulated in the upper soil layers for oilseed crops. The estimated root distribution patterns from the present study could be incorporated into agroecosystem models for good representations of belowground processes and enhance the accuracy of carbon and water cycling estimation in agroecosystem.},

Mineral soil samples, taken from four Scottish soils at different depths (08, 816, 1624, 2432 cm), were analyzed and incubated in the laboratory under constant temperature and environmental conditions. The vegetation type/plant species showed significant effects on the absolute concentration of C components and microbial activity, but the relative distribution of C and respiration rate with soil depth are similar across sites. Soil C pools and microbial respiratory activity declined rapidly with soil depth, with about 30\% of total organic carbon (TOC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and about half microbial carbon (Cmic) and respired CO2 observed in the top 8 cm. The ratio of CO2:TOC generally decreased with soil depth, but CO2:DOC was significantly higher in the top 8 cm of soil than in the subsoil (832 cm). No general pattern between qCO2 (CO2:Cmic) and soil depth was found. The vertical distributions of soil C pools and microbial respiratory activity were best fitted with a single exponential equation. Compared with TOC and DOC, Cmic appears to be an adequate predictor for the variation in microbial respiration rate with soil depth, with 95\% of variation in normalized respiration rate accounted for by a linear relationship.},

  abstract = {Bioenergy is becoming an important option in Global Change mitigation policy world-wide. In agriculture, cultivation of energy crops for biodiesel, biogas, or bioethanol production received considerable attention in the past decades. Beyond this, the cultivation of Miscanthus, used as solid fuel for combustion, may lead to an increase in soil organic matter content compared to other agricultural land use, since C-sequestration potential in soils of Miscanthus crops is high due to, e.g., high amounts of harvest residues. This may indirectly contribute to a reduction of atmospheric CO2 concentration. The objective of the present work was to investigate the development of soil organic carbon and Miscanthus-derived C contents, as well as to estimate carbon stocks in soils cultivated with Miscanthus using 13C-natural-abundance technique. The investigations were carried out in relation to soil depth up to 150?cm in a sequence of 2, 5, and 16 y of cultivation relative to a reference soil cultivated with cereals. Amounts of total organic C (TOC) and Miscanthus-derived C (Miscanthus-C) increased with increasing duration of cultivation. For example, TOC increased from 12.8 to 21.3 g C?kg1 after 16 y of cultivation at the depth of 015?cm, whereby the portion of Miscanthus-C reached 5.8 g C?kg1. Also within deeper soil layers down to 60?cm depth a significant enhancement of Miscanthus-C was detectable even though TOC contents were not significantly enhanced. At soil depth below 60?cm, no significant differences between treatments were found for Miscanthus-C. Within 16 y of continuous commercial farming, Miscanthus stands accumulated a total of 17.7 Mg C ha1 derived from Miscanthus residues (C4-C), which is equivalent to 1.1 Mg C4-C ha1 y1. The annual surplus might function as CO2 credit within a greenhouse-gas balance. Moreover, the beneficial properties of Miscanthus cultivation combined with a low requirement on fertilization may justify the status of Miscanthus as a sustainable low-input bioenergy crop.},

  abstract = {Organic carbon (C) associated with fine soil particles ({$<$}20 μm) is relatively stable and accounts for a large proportion of total soil organic C (SOC). The soil C saturation concept proposes a maximal amount of SOC that can be stabilized in the fine soil fraction, and the soil C saturation deficit (i. e., the difference between current SOC and the maximal amount) is presumed to affect the capacity, magnitude, and rate of SOC storage. In this study, we argue that predictions using current models underestimate maximal organic C stabilization of fine soil particles due to fundamental limitations of using least-squares linear regression. The objective was to improve predictions of maximal organic C stabilization by using two alternative approaches; one mechanistic, based on organic C loadings, and one statistical, based on boundary line analysis. We collected 342 data points on the organic C content of fine soil particles, fine particle mass proportions in bulk soil, dominant soil mineral types, and land use types from 32 studies. Predictions of maximal organic C stabilization using linear regression models are questionable because of the use of data from soils that may not be saturated in SOC and because of the nature of regression itself, resulting in a high proportion of presumed over-saturated samples. Predictions of maximal organic C stabilization using the organic C loading approach fit the data for soils dominated by 2:1 minerals well, but not soils dominated by 1:1 minerals; suggesting that the use of a single value for specific surface area, and therefore a single organic C loading, to represent a large dataset is problematic. In boundary line analysis, only data representing soils having reached the maximal amount (upper tenth percentile) were used. The boundary line analysis estimate of maximal organic C stabilization (78 ± 4 g C kg-1fraction) was more than double the estimate by the linear regression approach (33 ± 1 g C kg-1fraction). These results show that linear regression models do not adequately predict maximal organic C stabilization. Soil properties associated with soil mineralogy, such as specific surface area and organic C loading, should be incorporated to generate more mechanistic models for predicting soil C saturation, but in their absence, statistical models should represent the upper envelope rather than the average value. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

This may be due to a decline in soil organic matter (SOM) stability as the result of changes in the type, strength or turnover time of organo-mineral interactions with increasing organic C input. The goal of this study was to test whether the stability of organic matter bound to soil minerals decreases as organo-mineral complexes approach C saturation with increasing C loading. A series of batch sorption experiments with natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) and soil mineral components was conducted to obtain organo-mineral complexes with a range of organic C loadings. The relative stability of C in these organo-mineral complexes was subsequently assessed using evolved CO2 gas analysis during thermal analyses and laboratory incubations. Results indicated that differences in dissolved organic C before and after sorption overestimated the amount of sorbed C when compared to differences in solid-phase C concentrations. Values of C/N, δ13C, and δ15N of the organo-mineral complexes were significantly smaller or more negative than initial soil samples or the stock DOM solution, consistent with the concept of molecular fractionation by sorption to minerals and suggesting that the composition of the organic matter in the organo-mineral complexes may have changed as the amount of sorbed organic matter increased. Observations that organic C loadings at maximum sorption did not substantially exceed 1mgCm-2 and linear rather than asymptotic relations between sorbed C and initial DOM concentrations suggest that organo-mineral complexes may not have reached C saturation under the conditions in the batch sorption experiments of this study. The temperature at which half of the CO2 evolved during thermal analysis (i.e., CO2-T50) increased with increasing C loading, suggesting the sorbed C required greater energy input for combustion. Results of the laboratory incubations to determine relative biological stability of sorbed C were not consistent with the initial hypothesis. The size of potentially mineralizable C pool relative to the total sorbed C decreased with increasing C loading, even though this pool was being degraded more rapidly. Overall, the results did not support the hypothesis that SOM stability decreases with increasing C loading. In spite of generating a wide range of C loadings substantially greater than previous studies, the conditions of the DOM sorption experiments conducted in this study appeared unable to generate organo-mineral complexes exhibiting C saturation behavior. We speculate that measurable decreases in SOM stability may occur only once the threshold of C saturation is reached. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Improving predictions of soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics by multi-compartment models requires validation of turnover times of different SOC pools. Techniques such as laboratory incubation and isotope analysis have been adopted to estimate C turnover times, yet no studies have systematically compared these techniques and assessed the uncertainties associated with them. Here, we tested whether C turnover times of soil fractions were biased by methodology, and how this changed across soil particle sizes and ecosystems. We identified 52 studies that quantified C turnover times in different soil particles fractionated either according to aggregate size (e.g., macro- versus micro-aggregates) or according to soil texture (e.g., sand versus silt versus clay). C turnover times of these soil fractions were estimated by one of three methods: laboratory incubation (16 studies), δ13C shift due to C3-C4 vegetation change (25 studies), and 14C dating (19 studies). All methods showed that C turnover times of soil fractions generally increase with decreasing soil particle size. However, estimates of C turnover times within soil fractions differed significantly among methods, with incubation estimating the shortest turnover times and 14C the longest. The short C turnover times estimated by incubation are likely due to optimal environmental conditions for microbial decomposition existing in these studies, which is often a poor representation of field conditions. The 13C method can only be used when documenting a successive C3 versus C4 vegetation shift. C turnover times estimated by 14C were systematically higher than those estimated by 13C, especially for fine soil fractions (i.e., silt and clay). Overall, our findings highlight methodological uncertainties in estimating C turnover times of soil fractions, and correction factors should be explored to account for methodological bias when C turnover times estimated from different methods are used to parameterize soil C models.},

  abstract = {Soil solutions were collected monthly by tension and zero-tension lysimeters in a low- elevation red spruce stand in east-central Maine from May 1987 through December 1992. Soil solutions collected by Oa tension lysimeters had higher concentrations of most constituents than the Oa zero-tension lysimeters. In Oa horizon soil solutions growing season concentrations for SO4, Ca, and Mg averaged 57, 43, and 30 \#mol L -l in tension lysimeters, and 43, 28, and 19 \#mol L -1 in zero-tension lysimeters, respectively. Because tension lysimeters remove water held by the soil at tensions up to 10 kPa, solutions are assumed to have more time to react with the soil compared to freely draining solutions collected by zero-tension lysimeters. Solutions collected in the Bs horizon by both types of collectors were similar which was attributed to the frequency of time periods when the water table was above the Bs lysimeters. Concentrations of SO4 and NO3 at this site were lower than concentrations reported for most other eastern U.S. spruce-fir sites, but base cation concentrations fell in the same range. Aluminum concentrations in this study were also lower than reported for other sites in the eastern U.S. and Ca/A1 ratios did not suggest inhibition of Ca uptake by roots. Concentrations of SO4, Ca, K, and C1 decreased significantly in both the Oa and Bs horizons over the 56-month sampling period, which could reflect decreasing deposition rates for sulfur and base cations, climatic influences, or natural variation. A longer record of measured fluxes will be needed to adequately define temporal trends in solution chemistry and their causes. 1.},

  abstract = {Ramped pyrolysis (RP) targets distinct components of soil and sedimentary organic carbon based on their thermochemical stabilities and allows the determination of the full spectrum of radiocarbon ((14)C) ages present in a soil or sediment sample. Extending the method into realms where more precise ages are needed or where smaller samples need to be measured involves better understanding of the blank contamination associated with the method. Here, we use a compiled data set of RP measurements of samples of known age to evaluate the mass of the carbon blank and its associated (14)C signature, and to assess the performance of the RP system. We estimate blank contamination during RP using two methods, the modern-dead and the isotope dilution method. Our results indicate that during one complete RP run samples are contaminated by 8.8 ± 4.4 μg (time-dependent) of modern carbon (MC, fM ∼ 1) and 4.1 ± 5.5 μg (time-independent) of dead carbon (DC, fM ∼ 0). We find that the modern-dead method provides more accurate estimates of uncertainties in blank contamination; therefore, the isotope dilution method should be used with caution when the variability of the blank is high. Additionally, we show that RP can routinely produce accurate (14)C dates with precisions ∼100 (14)C years for materials deposited in the last 10,000 years and ∼300 (14)C years for carbon with (14)C ages of up to 20,000 years.},

Unfortunately, little is known about how these practices influence soil structure and quality. There is a lack of information on the consequences of these practices on the soil fractions coarser than 2mm, which are known as rock fragments or skeletal material, the focus of this study. Soil samples were obtained from depths of 0-20 and 20-40cm and analysed for pH, electrical conductivity, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and total and active calcium carbonate. For each soil depth, we determined the amount of fine earth and skeletal material by volume. The results indicate that rock fragmentation and/or deep ploughing cause a major change in soils, leading to the progressive reduction in total organic carbon and nitrogen, and to an increase in total and active calcium carbonate. In addition, there was a marked increase in skeletal material compared to undisturbed soil. The results confirm that rock fragmentation causes significant changes in soil physical properties and increases greatly the amount of skeletal material. © 2012 The Authors.

  abstract = {The Scottish Government is committed to reduce carbon emissions by 80\% by 2050 (compared to a 1990–1995 baseline). Peatlands have been recognised as a key environment for the carbon balance as they sequester and store great quantities of carbon, but they also have the potential to release it. In Scotland, peatlands cover more than 20\%ofthe surface (more than 90\%of which is blanket bog) and store more than 2500 Mt of carbon. Blanket bogs are very climate reliant, and as a consequence of climate change, many areas in Scotland may not be able to support peatlands in the near future. In this study, two bioclimatic envelope models (Linsday Modified model and Blanket Bog Tree model) have been used to obtain a first estimate of how the distribution of blanket bogs in Scotland could vary according to climate change in the 2050s and in the 2080s. The potential losses ofcarbon arising from climate change have then been calculated. Results showed that in 2050, more than halfofthe carbon currently stored in Scottish blanket bogs will be at risk ofloss. This is 4.4–6.6 times the amount ofcarbon emitted in 2016 from all the sectors in Scotland and, if emissions from peatland occur and are taken into account, it will greatly hamper efforts to meet emission reduction targets set out in the Climate Change (Scotland) Act of 2009.},

  abstract = {Soil drying and rewetting impose a significant stress on the soil microbial community. While wetting events are common in most environments, the short and long-term effects of soil rewetting on microbial processes have not been well studied. Furthermore, it is not clear if stress history is important to consider when modeling microbial controls on ecosystem dynamics. In this experiment, we manipulated the frequency of soil rewetting events during 2 months to determine how stress history influences the response of soil microbial communities to rewetting events. Two soils were collected from the Sedgwick Ranch Natural Reserve in Santa Ynez, CA, one from an annual grassland, the other from underneath an oak canopy. Soils were incubated in the lab and went through either 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, or 15 drying-rewetting cycles over 2 months. Soil moisture content was adjusted so that the average moisture content over the course of the incubation was the same for all samples, compensating for the number of drying-rewetting cycles. Soils were analyzed for respiration rate, substrate utilization efficiency, nitrification potential, microbial biomass, and NH 4+ and NO 3- concentrations. Total CO 2 loss during incubation significantly increased with number of rewetting events for oak soils but not for grass soils, where a large number of rewetting events decreased total CO 2 loss. Exposure to frequent drying-rewetting events decreased the amount of CO 2 released upon rewetting and dramatically increased the activity of autotrophic nitrifier populations. For up to 6 weeks after the last drying-rewetting cycle, respiration rates in soils exposed to a history of drying-rewetting events were substantially lower than their non-stressed controls. In all cases, the effects of the rewetting stress were greater in oak than in grass soils. The results indicate that drying-rewetting events can induce significant changes in microbial C and N dynamics and these effects can last for more than a month after the last stress. The frequency of drying-rewetting stress events has important ecosystem-level ramifications and should be incorporated into models of soil microbial dynamics. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {The rapid rewetting of a dry soil often yields a pulse in soil CO2 production that persists for 2 to 6 d. This phenomenon is a common occurrence in surface soils, yet the mechanism responsible for producing the CO2 pulse has not been positively identified. We studied the effects of a single drying and rewetting event on soil C pools, to identify which specific C substrates are mineralized to produce the observed pulse in respiration rates. We labeled two soils with 14C-glucose and measured the enrichment and pool sizes of the released CO2, extractable biomass C, and extractable soil organic matter (SOM-C) throughout a drying and rewetting cycle. After rewetting, respiration rates were 475 to 370\% higher than the rates measured before the dry down. The enrichment of the released CO2 was 1 to 2 times higher than the enrichment of the extractable biomass C pools and 10 to 20 times higher than the enrichment of the extractable organic C, suggesting that the CO2 pulse was generated entirely from the mineralization of microbial biomass C. However, there was no evidence of substantial microbial cell lysis on rewetting. We hypothesize that the pulse of CO2 is generated by the rapid mineralization of highly enriched intracellular compounds as a response by the microbial biomass to the rapid increase in soil water potentials. The drying and rewetting process also releases physically protected SOM, increasing the amount of extractable SOM-C by up to 200\%. The additional SOM-C rendered soluble by the rewetting event did not contribute substantially to the rewetting CO2 pulse. Overall, the rapid rewetting of a dry soil can influence soil C cycling in the short-term, by increasing the microbial mineralization of cytoplasmic solutes, and in the longer-term, by decreasing the total amount of SOM physically protected within microaggregates.},

  abstract = {Soil profiles are often many meters deep, but with the majority of studies in soil microbiology focusing exclusively on the soil surface, we know very little about the nature of the microbial communities inhabiting the deeper soil horizons. We used phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis to examine the vertical distribution of specific microbial groups and to identify the patterns of microbial abundance and community-level diversity within the soil profile. Samples were collected from the soil surface down to 2 m in depth from two unsaturated Mollisol profiles located near Santa Barbara, CA, USA. While the densities of microorganisms were generally one to two orders of magnitude lower in the deeper horizons of both profiles than at the soil surface, approximately 35\% of the total quantity of microbial biomass found in the top 2 m of soil is found below a depth of 25 cm. Principal components analysis of the PLFA signatures indicates that the composition of the soil microbial communities changes significantly with soil depth. The differentiation of microbial communities within the two profiles coincides with an overall decline in microbial diversity. The number of individual PLFAs detected in soil samples decreased by about a third from the soil surface down to 2 m. The ratios of cyclopropyl/monoenoic precursors and total saturated/total monounsaturated fatty acids increased with soil depth, suggesting that the microbes inhabiting the deeper soil horizons are more carbon limited than surface-dwelling microbes. Using PLFAs as biomarkers, we show that Gram-positive bacteria and actinomycetes tended to increase in proportional abundance with increasing soil depth, while the abundances of Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and protozoa were highest at the soil surface and substantially lower in the subsurface. The vertical distribution of these specific microbial groups can largely be attributed to the decline in carbon availability with soil depth. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Thus, it is widely acknowledged that soil health is important to quantify, both for assessment and as a tool to help guide management strategies. What is less clear is how soil health should actually be measured, especially considering that soil health is not exclusively a product of soil physical and chemical characteristics. Given their well-established importance to many aspects of soil health, microbes and microbial processes are often used as metrics of soil health with a range of different microbe-based metrics routinely used across the globe. Unfortunately, it is our opinion that many of these pre-existing microbial measurements are not easy to interpret and may not necessarily provide credible inferences about soil health status. Here we review the microbial indices used to assess or monitor soil health and discuss some of the broader issues associated with their use. We provide recommendations to more effectively guide and improve how microbial information could be used to yield relevant and actionable assessments of soil health.},

  abstract = {Secondary minerals (clays and metal oxides) are important components of the soil matrix. Clay minerals affect soil carbon persistence and cycling, and they also select for distinct microbial communities. Here we show that soil mineral assemblages—particularly short-range order minerals—affect both bacterial community composition and taxon-specific growth. Three soils with different parent material and presence of short-range order minerals were collected from ecosystems with similar vegetation and climate. These three soils were provided with 18O-labeled water and incubated with or without artificial root exudates or pine needle litter. Quantitative stable isotope probing was used to determine taxon-specific growth. We found that the growth of bacteria varied among soils of different mineral assemblages but found the trend of growth suppression in the presence of short-range order minerals. Relative growth of bacteria declined with increasing concentration of short-range order minerals between 25–36\% of taxa present in all soils. Carbon addition in the form of plant litter or root exudates weakly affected relative growth of taxa (p = 0.09) compared to the soil type (p {$<$} 0.01). However, both exudate and litter carbon stimulated growth for at least 34\% of families in the soils with the most and least short-range order minerals. In the intermediate short-range order soil, fresh carbon reduced growth for more bacterial families than were stimulated. These results highlight how bacterial-mineral-substrate interactions are critical to soil organic carbon processing, and how growth variation in bacterial taxa in these interactions may contribute to soil carbon persistence and loss.},

  abstract = {Low bioavailability of organic carbon (C) and energy are key constraints to microbial biomass and activity. Microbial biomass, biodiversity and activity are all involved in regulating soil ecosystem services such as plant productivity, nutrient cycling and greenhouse gas emissions. A number of agricultural practices, of which tillage and fertiliser application are two examples, can increase the availability of soil organic C (SOC). Such practices often lead to reductions in soil aggregation and increases in SOC loss and greenhouse gas emissions. This review focuses on how the bioavailability of SOC and energy influence the ecology and functioning of microorganisms in agricultural soils. Firstly we consider how management practices affect the bioavailability of SOC and energy at the ecosystem level. Secondly we consider the interaction between SOC bioavailability and ecological principles that shape microbial community composition and function in agricultural systems. Lastly, we discuss and compare several examples of physiological differences that underlie how microbial species respond to C availability and management practices. We present evidence whereby management practices that increase the bioavailability of SOC alter community structure and function to favour microbial species likely to be associated with increased rates of SOC loss compared to natural ecosystems. We argue that efforts to restore stabilised, sequestered SOC stocks and improve ecosystem services in agricultural systems should be directed toward the manipulation of the microbial community composition and function to favour species associated with reduced rates of SOC loss. We conclude with several suggestions regarding where improvements in multi-disciplinary approaches concerning soil microbiology can be made to improve the sustainability of agricultural systems.},

  abstract = {Low molecular weight organic substances (LMWOS) in soil and soil solution include mainly amino acids, carboxylic acids, and carbohydrates. Due to their high bioavailability they play a crucial role in the cycles of C and nutrients in soils. The variety of soil processes that involve LMWOS requires identifying their composition to elucidate reactions and transformations. In most studies, LMWOS are extracted under artificial conditions, e.g. batch experiments, which may overestimate the actual concentrations. This study measures the composition of carbohydrates and amino acids in solution of a Haplic Luvisol leached in a column experiment. A combined system for simultaneous leaching and blowout of CO2 was used to estimate LMWOS decomposition. 14C-labeled glucose was added as a highly sensitive tracer to control the efficiency of the LMWOS extraction by leaching and to estimate LMWOS decomposition during leaching. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), optimized for soil extracts, was used to analyze LMWOS composition. For HPLC optimization, different preparations of leached solutions (filtration vs. centrifugation, and drying vs. no-drying) were compared. For sugar determination, drying had no influence on the solution concentrations. In contrast, amino acid concentrations significantly decreased by drying LMWOS eluted substances. Combining the HPLC identification of eluted substances with 14C tracer application revealed that about 5\% of the glucose could be leached unchanged within 786 min (13.1 h), whereas about 84\% remained in the soil, 9\% were decomposed to CO2, and 2\% were transformed to other LMWOS and recovered in the soil solution. The total amino acid concentration (TAC) in soil solution was about 8.2 μmol l-1, dominated by alanine (14.4\% of TAC), glycine (13.4\%), glutamic acid (9.9\%), serine (9.4\%), and leucine (9.3\%). The total carbohydrate concentration was about 2.4 μM, dominated by glucose (29.9\%), glucuronic acid (26.8\%), and galacturonic acid (17.3\%). Ratios of hexoses to pentoses, amino sugars glucosamine to galactosamine, and neutral sugars to uronic acids were determined. All three parameters pointed to the dominant influence of plants as the source of LMWOS in the leached soil solution. Within the small contribution of microorganisms, bacteria dominated over fungi. These used biomarker ratios as well as LMWOS concentrations differed widely from the ones obtained with conventional batch extraction. More research is necessary to evaluate the application of these biomarkers to soil solutions. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Functional biodiversity research explores drivers and functional consequences of biodiversity changes. Land use change is a major driver of changes of biodiversity and of biogeochemical and biological ecosystem processes and services. However, land use effects on genetic and species diversity are well documented only for a few taxa and trophic networks. We hardly know how different components of biodiversity and their responses to land use change are interrelated and very little about the simultaneous, and interacting, effects of land use on multiple ecosystem processes and services. Moreover, we do not know to what extent land use effects on ecosystem processes and services are mediated by biodiversity change. Thus, overall goals are on the one hand to understand the effects of land use on biodiversity, and on the other to understand the modifying role of biodiversity change for land-use effects on ecosystem processes, including biogeochemical cycles. To comprehensively address these important questions, we recently established a new large-scale and long-term project for functional biodiversity, the Biodiversity Exploratories (www.biodiversity-exploratories.de). They comprise a hierarchical set of standardized field plots in three different regions of Germany covering manifold management types and intensities in grasslands and forests. They serve as a joint research platform for currently 40 projects involving over 300 people studying various aspects of the relationships between land use, biodiversity and ecosystem processes through monitoring, comparative observation and experiments. We introduce guiding questions, concept and design of the Biodiversity Exploratories - including main aspects of selection and implementation of field plots and project structure - and we discuss the significance of this approach for further functional biodiversity research. This includes the crucial relevance of a common study design encompassing variation in both drivers and outcomes of biodiversity change and ecosystem processes, the interdisciplinary integration of biodiversity and ecosystem researchers, the training of a new generation of integrative biodiversity researchers, and the stimulation of functional biodiversity research in real landscape contexts, in Germany and elsewhere. © 2010 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.},

  abstract = {Modern soil mapping is characterised by the need to interpolate point referenced (geostatistical) observations and the availability of large numbers of environmental characteristics for consideration as covariates to aid this interpolation. Modelling tasks of this nature also occur in other fields such as biogeography and environmental science. This analysis employs the Least Angle Regression (LAR) algorithm for fitting Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) penalized Multiple Linear Regressions models. This analysis demonstrates the efficiency of the LAR algorithm at selecting covariates to aid the interpolation of geostatistical soil carbon observations. Where an exhaustive search of the models that could be constructed from 800 potential covariate terms and 60 observations would be prohibitively demanding, LASSO variable selection is accomplished with trivial computational investment.},

  abstract = {For a quantitative analysis of SOC dynamics it is necessary to trace the origins of the soil organic compounds and the pathways of their transformations. We used the 13C isotope to determine the incorporation of maize residues into the soil organic carbon (SOC), to trace the origin of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and to quantify the fraction of the maize C in the soil respiration. The maize-derived SOC was quantified in soil samples collected to a depth of 65 cm from two plots, one 'continuous maize' and the other 'continuous rye' (reference site) from the long-term field experiment 'Ewiger Roggen' in Halle. This field trial was established in 1878 and was partly changed to a continuous maize cropping system in 1961. Production rates and δ13C of DOC and CO2 were determined for the Ap horizon in incubation experiments with undisturbed soil columns. After 37 years of continuous maize cropping, 15\% of the total SOC in the topsoil originated from maize C. The fraction of the maize-derived C below the ploughed horizon was only 5 to 3\%. The total amount of maize C stored in the profile was 9080 kg ha−1 which was equal to about 31\% of the estimated total C input via maize residues (roots and stubble). Total leaching of DOC during the incubation period of 16 weeks was 1.1 g m−2 and one third of the DOC derived from maize C. The specific DOC production rate from the maize-derived SOC was 2.5 times higher than that from the older humus formed by C3 plants. The total CO2-C emission for 16 weeks was 18 g m−2. Fifty-eight percent of the soil respiration originated from maize C. The specific CO2 formation from maize-derived SOC was 8 times higher than that from the older SOC formed by C3 plants. The ratio of DOC production to CO2-C production was three times smaller for the young, maize-derived SOC than for the older humus formed by C3 plants.},

  abstract = {Soil organic matter is the earth's largest terrestrial reservoir of carbon (C). Thus, it serves as a major control on atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) levels. To better understand these controls, decreases in soil organic C (SOC), soil microbial biomass (SMB) C, and the role of SMB as a source of mineralizable C were measured during a long-term incubation (853 days) without added substrate. The 2 soils used were a Weld loam (fine montmorillonitic, mesic, Aridic Paleustoll) from near Akron, Colorado, and a Duroc loam (fine silty, mixed mesic Pachic Haplustoll) from near Sidney, Nebraska. The Akron soil was uniformly cropped to small grain crop-fallow rotations until 1989 when wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in conventional (stubble mulch) till-fallow, reduced till-fallow, and no-till fallow treatments were adopted. On additional rotation plots, continuous corn (Zea mays L.) or no-till corn, fallow, wheat, and no-till corn in a 4-year rotation were grown. The Sidney soil was broken from native sod in 1970 and planted to wheat-fallow with no-till, plow-tillage, and sod-plot treatments. Moist soil samples were collected and refrigerated until plant material removal by sieving and picking. The SOC and SMB-C decreased during incubation and rates of loss measured. The results from this study allow insights into contributions of SMB and changes in soil isotope C ratios not previously available. Soil microbial biomass C contributed an average of 31\% of the evolved CO2-C across all treatments between day 10 and day 79 of incubation and an average of about 20\% during the more extended times between later measurements thereafter. Until day 160, evolution of 13CO2 during incubation indicated that evolved C came from plant residues and was soil derived thereafter, including from the native grassland SOC. Where corn was grown, evolution of evolved C is hypothesized to have had a less negative 13CO2 isotope signature from days 630 to 720 of the incubation because of the delayed microbial breakdown of the cob materials. After 853 days of incubation and across all plots, the SOC remaining averaged 67\% and was similar to the amount of observed hydrolysis residue C. Acid hydrolysis and 14C dating were also used to characterize the resistant SOC fraction and showed increased 14C age with hydrolysis but not with long-term incubation.

Life cycle assessments (LCA) for bioenergy crops have been conducted using models in which SOC information is usually from the top 30 to 40 cm. Information on the effects of crop management practices on SOC has been limited so LCA models have largely not included any management practice effects. In the first 9 years of a long-term C sequestration study in eastern Nebraska, USA, switchgrass and maize with best management practices had average annual increases in SOC per hectare that exceed 2 Mg C year −1 (7.3 Mg CO 2 year −1 ) for the 0 to 150 soil depth. For both switchgrass and maize, over 50 \% of the increase in SOC was below the 30 cm depth. SOC sequestration by switchgrass was twofold to fourfold greater than that used in models to date which also assumed no SOC sequestration by maize. The results indicate that N fertilizer rates and harvest management regimes can affect the magnitude of SOC sequestration. The use of uniform soil C effects for bioenergy crops from sampling depths of 30 to 40 cm across agro-ecoregions for large scale LCA is questionable.},

  abstract = {The world's soils store more carbon than is present in biomass and in the atmosphere. Little is known, however, about the factors controlling the stability of soil organic carbon stocks and the response of the soil carbon pool to climate change remains uncertain. We investigated the stability of carbon in deep soil layers in one soil profile by combining physical and chemical characterization of organic carbon, soil incubations and radiocarbon dating. Here we show that the supply of fresh plant-derived carbon to the subsoil (0.6-0.8 m depth) stimulated the microbial mineralization of 2,567 ± 226-year-old carbon. Our results support the previously suggested idea that in the absence of fresh organic carbon, an essential source of energy for soil microbes, the stability of organic carbon in deep soil layers is maintained. We propose that a lack of supply of fresh carbon may prevent the decomposition of the organic carbon pool in deep soil layers in response to future changes in temperature. Any change in land use and agricultural practice that increases the distribution of fresh carbon along the soil profile could however stimulate the loss of ancient buried carbon. ©2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

With increased recognition of limitations of fossil fuels, fresh water, and available farmland, educators are changing focus from strategies to reach maximum yields to those that feature resource use efficiency and resilience of production systems in a less benign climate. To help students deal with complexity and uncertainty and a wide range of biological and social dimensions of the food challenge, a whole-systems approach that involves life-cycle analysis and consideration of long-term impacts of systems is essential. Seven educational case studies in the Nordic Region and the U.S. Midwest demonstrate how educators can incorporate theory of the ecology of food systems with the action learning component needed to develop student potentials to create responsible change in society. New roles of agroecology instructors and students are described as they pursue a co-learning strategy to develop and apply technology to assure the productivity and security of future food systems.

  abstract = {Despite efforts to understand the factors that determine soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in terrestrial ecosystems, there remains little information on how SOC turnover time varies among ecosystems, and how SOC turnover time and C input, via plant production, differentially contribute to regional patterns of SOC stocks. In this study, we determined SOC stocks (gC m −2 ) and used soil radiocarbon measurements to derive mean SOC turnover time (years) for 0–10 cm mineral soil at ten sites across North America that included arctic tundra, northern boreal, northern and southern hardwood, subtropical, and tropical forests, tallgrass and shortgrass prairie, mountain grassland, and desert. SOC turnover time ranged 36-fold among ecosystems, and was much longer for cold tundra and northern boreal forest and dry desert (1277–2151 years) compared to other warmer and wetter habitats (59–353 years). Two measures of C input, net aboveground production (NAP), determined from the literature, and a radiocarbon-derived measure of C flowing to the 0–10 cm mineral pool, I , were positively and SOC turnover time was negatively associated with mean annual evapotranspiration (ET) among ecosystems. The best fit model generated from the independent variables NAP, I, annual mean temperature and precipitation, ET, and clay content revealed that SOC stock was best explained by the single variable I . Overall, these findings indicate the primary role that C input and the secondary role that C stabilization play in determining SOC stocks at large regional spatial scales and highlight the large vulnerability of the global SOC pool to climate change.},

Methodologies for estimating this process vary due to a variety of theoreti- cal, functional, and expediency considerations. We tested the effects of soil processing (sieve size), water delivery method (from top and from capillary), and soil organic matter content (two levels based on depth of sampling) on mineralizable C and N during 0 to 1, 0 to 3, and 0 to 24 d of incubation from soils ranging in texture. Mineralizable C was not affected by sieve size, sug- gesting that fine grinding should not affect results. Water delivery method did affect mineralizable C estimates at 0 to 1 and 0 to 3 d of incubation, as water delivered by capillary allowed soil to absorb to 70 ± 5\% water-filled pore space compared with controlled delivery to 50\% water-filled pore space from the top. The extra water only hindered mineralizable C in soils with coarse texture (i.e., sandy loam), whereas mineralizable C in other soil textures was not affected. Net N mineralization during 24 d of incubation was negatively impacted by the higher water content, independent of soil texture, but more so when soils high in organic matter were sieved coarsely than when sieved finely. Despite these variations, close association occurred between mineral- izable C (0 to 1 and 0 to 3 d) and net N mineralization (0 to 24 d at 50\% water-filled pore space), suggesting that length of incubation and method of water delivery should not restrict the choice of methodological variation from those used here to assess soil biological activity. However, a standard methodology has become increasingly necessary to compare absolute values across management systems, farm types, and regions.},

This has made their inclusion in mechanistic models of OM turnover or nutrient cycling difficult despite the potential power of these models to unravel complex interactions. Using high temporal-resolution respirometery (6 min measurement intervals), we monitored the respiratory response of 67 soils sampled from across England and Wales over a 5 day period following the addition of a complex organic substrate (green barley powder). Four respiratory response archetypes were observed, characterised by different rates of respiration as well as different time-dependent patterns. We also found that it was possible to predict, with 95\% accuracy, which type of respiratory behaviour a soil would exhibit based on certain physical and chemical soil properties combined with the size and phenotypic structure of the microbial community. Bulk density, microbial biomass carbon, water holding capacity and microbial community phenotype were identified as the four most important factors in predicting the soils' respiratory responses using a Bayesian belief network. These results show that the size and constitution of the microbial community are as important as physico-chemical properties of a soil in governing the respiratory response to OM addition. Such a combination suggests that the ‘architecture' of the soil, i.e. the integration of the spatial organisation of the environment and the interactions between the communities living and functioning within the pore networks, is fundamentally important in regulating such processes.},

A primary control on soil CO2 flux is the efficiency with which the microbial community uses C. Despite its critical importance to soil–atmosphere CO2 exchange, relatively few studies have examined the factors controlling soil microbial efficiency. Here, we measured the temperature response of microbial efficiency in soils amended with substrates varying in lability. We also examined the temperature sensitivity of microbial efficiency in response to chronic soil warming in situ. We find that the efficiency with which soil microorganisms use organic matter is dependent on both temperature and substrate quality, with efficiency declining with increasing temperatures for more recalcitrant substrates. However, the utilization efficiency of a more recalcitrant substrate increased at higher temperatures in soils exposed to almost two decades of warming 5 ◦C above ambient. Our work suggests that climate warming could alter the decay dynamics of more stable organic matter compounds, thereby having a positive feedback to climate that is attenu- ated by a shift towards a more efficient microbial community in the longer term.},

  abstract = {In the context of phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, most climate simulations use prescribed atmospheric CO2 concentration and therefore do not interactively include the effect of carbon cycle feedbacks. However, the representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenario has additionally been run by earth system models with prescribed CO2 emissions. This paper analyzes the climate projections of 11 earth system models (ESMs) that performed both emission-driven and concentration-driven RCP8.5 simulations.When forced by RCP8.5 CO2 emissions, models simulate a large spread in atmospheric CO2; the simulated 2100 concentrations range between 795 and 1145 ppm. Seven out of the 11 ESMs simulate a larger CO2 (on average by 44 ppm, 985 6 97ppm by 2100) and hence higher radiative forcing (by 0.25Wm22) when driven by CO2 emissions than for the concentration-driven scenarios (941 ppm). However, most of these models already overestimate the present-day CO2, with the present-day biases reasonably well correlated with future atmospheric concentrations' departure from the prescribed concentration. The uncertainty in CO2 projections is mainly attributable to uncertainties in the response of the land carbon cycle. As a result of simulated higher CO2 concentrations than in the concentration-driven simulations, temperature projections are generally higher when ESMs are driven with CO2 emissions.

  abstract = {Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) leached from recent litter in the forest fl oor has been sug- gested to be an important source of C to the mineral soil of forest ecosystems. To determine the rate at which this fl ux of C occurs, we have taken advantage of a local release of 14C at Oak Ridge National Laboratory Reservation, Oak Ridge, TN (35°58′N, 84°16′W). Eight replicate 7- by 7-m plots were established at four fi eld sites on the reservation in an upland oak forest setting. Half of the plots were provided with 14C-enriched litter (Δ14C ≈ 1000‰), and the other half with near-background litter (Δ14C ≈ 220‰) for multiple years. Differences in the labeled leaf litter were used to quantify the movement of litter-derived DOC through the soil profi le. Soil solutions were collected for several years with tension lysimeters at 15- and 70-cm depths and measured for DOC concentration and 14C abundance. The net amount of DOC retained between 15 and 70 cm was between 2 and 10 g m−2 yr−1. There were signifi cant effects of the litter additions on the 14C abundance in the DOC, but the net transport of 14C from the added litter was small. The difference in Δ14C between the treatments with enriched and near-background litter was only about 130‰ at both depths, which is small compared with the difference in Δ14C in the added litter. The primary source of DOC within the mineral soil must therefore have been either the Oe or Oa horizon or the organic matter in the mineral soil. During a 2-yr time frame, leaching of DOC from recent litter did not have a major impact on the C stock in the mineral soil below 15 cm in this ecosystem.}

  abstract = {Mineral-associated organic matter is associated with a suite of soil minerals that can confer stability, resulting in the potential for long-term storage of carbon (C). Not all interactions impart the same level of protection, however; evidence is suggesting that C in certain mineral pools is dynamic and vulnerable to disturbance in the decades following harvesting. The objective of this research was to describe and characterize organic matter-mineral interactions through depth in horizons of soils of contrasting stand age. Sequential selective dissolutions representing increasingly stable mineral-associated organic matter pools from water soluble minerals (deionized water), organo-metal complexes (Na-pyrophosphate), poorly-crystalline minerals (HCl hydroxylamine), and crystalline secondary minerals (Na-dithionite HCl)) were carried out for Ae, Bf and BC horizons sampled from a Young and Mature forest site (35 and 110 years post-harvest) in Mooseland, Nova Scotia, Canada. Sequential selective dissolution extracts were analyzed for C, δ13C, iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al). Organo-metal complexes (OMC) were the largest mineral-associated OM pool in all horizons. This pool dominated the C distribution in B horizons (\$\textbackslash sim\$60–70\% of Bf bulk C), with a minor contribution from poorly-crystalline (PCrys), crystalline (Crys) minerals and water soluble (WS) associations. C in OMC and PCrys pools explained the variation in bulk C in horizons through depth at both sites. Twice as much C in OMC pools was measured at the Mature site compared to the Young site in the Bf horizons, supported by higher C:(Fe+Al) ratios. Isotopic analysis indicated that this extraction procedure isolated distinct mineral-associated OM pools. δ13C signatures of pyrophosphate-extracted OMC pools ranged from -27 to -28, similar to δ13C of bulk C and to plant-derived humic acids and associated biomass. The water soluble phase (mean δ13C = -29 ) was up to 2 more depleted, whereas the δ13C of Crys pools were more enriched in 13C (-13 to -16 ) compared to bulk soil. The results from this study suggest that association with minerals does not necessarily confer stability: organo-metal pools dominate in podzol horizons through depth, and contribute most to C storage, but are potentially susceptible to destabilization following the physical changes resulting from forest harvesting disturbance.},

In addition to not inviting relevant contributors to co-author a paper, the order of authors as well as honorary, gift, and ghost authors are all widely recognized problems related to authorship. Unfair authorship practices disproportionately affect those lower in the power hierarchies-early career researchers, women, researchers from the Global South, and other minoritized groups. Here we propose an approach to preparing author lists based on clear, transparent, and timely communication. This approach aims to minimize the potential for late-stage authorship conflicts during manuscript preparation by facilitating timely and transparent decisions on potential co-authors and their responsibilities. Furthermore, our approach can help avoid imbalances between contributions and credits in published papers by recording planned and executed responsibilities. We present authorship guidelines which also include a novel authorship form along with the documentation of the formulation process for a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary center with more than 250 researchers. Other research groups, departments, and centers can use or build on this template to design their own authorship guidelines as a practical way to promote fair authorship practices.},

Two hypotheses were tested in this study: 1) Al (and Fe) complexed with soil C and allophane content are the key variables to explain the soil C level in Chilean allophanic soils, and 2) the existing metal-SOM complex and short-range ordered aluminosilicate minerals in allophanic soils mainly result from soil pH variation and competition between Al (and Fe) for SOM and allophane formation. This study established the relationship among different soil properties such Al-, Fe-complexes and allophane content on soil C levels in Chilean volcanic soils as well as the effect of soil pH on metal-OM complexes. A total of 45 soil samples from 15 soil pedons were sampled at 0-0.1, 0.1-0.2 and 0-2-0.4m. The soil samples were analysed for the content of soil organic C, allophane, clay, silt and Na- pyrophosphate extraction (Al p, Fe p, C p) and soil pH (water). We examined the relationship between the soil C content and soil properties using simple and multiple linear regressions. The silt and clay contents explained little, while the allophane, soil pH and Al p explained most of the soil C variation. We found an inverse relationship between soil pH and Al p (and Fe p), indicating that the soil pH was significantly correlated with Al p and Fe p, while the allophane content was positively related with soil pH. The results also showed a higher atomic ratio (Al+Fe) p:C p in deep (0.2-0.4m) horizons; the opposite was true in the top soil horizon (0-0.1m), supporting the idea that SOM in deep soils is saturated with Al and Fe, leaving extra metal to react with silica for allophane formation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Temperate forests of North America are thought to be significant sinks of atmospheric CO2. We developed a below-ground carbon (C) budget for well-drained soils in Harvard Forest Massachusetts, an ecosystem that is storing C. Measurements of carbon and radiocarbon (C-14) inventory were used to determine the turnover time and maximum rate of CO2 production from heterotrophic respiration of three fractions of soil organic matter (SOM): recognizable litter fragments (L), humified low density material (H), and high density or mineral-associated organic matter (M). Turnover times in all fractions increased with soil depth and were 2-5 years for recognizable leaf litter, 5-10 years for root litter, 40-100+ years for low density humified material and {$>$} 100 years for carbon associated with minerals. These turnover times represent the time carbon resides in the plant + soil system, and may underestimate actual decomposition rates if carbon resides for several years in living root, plant or woody material. Soil respiration was partitioned into two components using C-14: recent photosynthate which is metabolized by roots and microorganisms within a year of initial fixation (Recent-C), and C that is respired during microbial decomposition of SOM that resides in the soil for several years or longer (Reservoir-C). For the whole soil, we calculate that decomposition of Reservoir-C contributes approximately 41\% of the total annual soil respiration. Of this 41\%, recognizable leaf or root detritus accounts for 80\% of the flux, and 20\% is from the more humified fractions that dominate the soil carbon stocks. Measurements of CO2 and (CO2)-C-14 in the soil atmosphere and in total soil respiration were combined with surface CO2 fluxes and a soil gas diffusion model to determine the flux and isotopic signature of C produced as a function of soil depth. 63\% of soil respiration takes place in the top 15 cm of the soil (O + A + Ap horizons). The average residence time of Reservoir-C in the plant + soil system is 8 +/- 1 years and the average age of carbon in total soil respiration (Recent-C + Reservoir-C) is 4 +/- 1 years. The O and A horizons have accumulated 4.4 kgC m(-2) above the plow layer since abandonment by settlers in the late-1800's. C pools contributing the most to soil respiration have short enough turnover times that they are likely in steady state. However, most C is stored as humified organic matter within both the O and A horizons and has turnover times from 40 to 100+ years respectively. These reservoirs continue to accumulate carbon at a combined rate of 10-30 gC m(-2) yr(-1). This rate of accumulation is only 5-15\% of the total ecosystem C sink measured in this stand using eddy covariance methods.},

  abstract = {Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) is an economically important, but relatively drought-sensitive tree species that might suffer from increasing drought intensities and frequencies, which are predicted to occur in parts of central Europe under future climatic change. In a throughfall exclusion experiment using sub-canopy roofs, we tested the hypothesis that enhanced drought leads to an increase in fine root mortality, and also to a higher, subsequent fine root growth. Fine root production and mortality were assessed using two independent approaches, sequential soil coring (organic layer) and direct observations in minirhizotrons (organic layer plus upper mineral soil). Six weeks of throughfall exclusion resulted in mild drought stress, i.e. a reduction in average soil moisture from 20 to 12 vol.\% during the treatment. Based on the sequential coring data, experimental drought did not result in significant changes in fine root biomass during the 6-week treatment period, but caused an increase in fine root mortality by 61\% in the 6 weeks following the drought treatment. Remarkably, fine root production showed a synchronous increase in this period, which more than compensated for the loss due to increased mortality. The minirhizotron data confirmed that the drought treatment increased fine root loss in the organic layer. Based on this method, however, root loss occurred during the drought period and was not compensated by increased root production. The mild drought stress was mainly restricted to the organic layer and did not significantly influence fine root dynamics in the mineral soil. We calculated that the drought event resulted in an extra input of about 28 g C m-2 and 1.1 g N m-2 to the soil due to increased fine root mortality. We conclude that even periods of mild drought significantly increase fine root mortality and the associated input of root-derived C to the soil organic matter pool in temperate Norway spruce forests. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

By far the strongest variability in. ne root longevity estimates was due to the chosen method of investigation, with radiocarbon analyses yielding much higher estimates (5.4 years) than sequential soil coring (0.9 years) and minirhizotron observations (0.7 years).

We present in this paper a freely available field based temporal GIS (TGRASS) that fulfills these requirements.

Soils higher in organic C appear darker than surrounding soils in aerial imagery aft er tillage, although this difference is only relative without knowledge of the range of SOC. This range could be estimated from Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database. To verify this, the SSURGO database was used to estimate the SOC range at three sites in central Iowa. Soil organic C content across each field was then linearly interpolated within the SSURGO-estimated range for each field using the brightness values at each pixel in the aerial photograph as a scaling factor. Measured SOC data from the three sites ranged from 3.4 to 50 g kg(-1) and the R(2) and RMSE values between the measured and estimated SOC concentrations ranged from 0.60 to 0.82 and 3.5 to 7.6 g kg(-1), respectively. Limited thresholding of the brightest and darkest pixels improved the accuracy and precision of SOC estimates over raw imagery. These results imply that aerial imagery supplemented by SSURGO-estimated SOC ranges can provide georeferenced SOC estimates suitable for site-specific recommendations and analysis without field sampling.},

  abstract = {© 2015 British Society of Soil Science.Permafrost degradation may cause strong feedbacks of arctic ecosystems to global warming, but this will depend on if, and to what extent, organic matter (OM) is protected against biodegradation by mechanisms other than freezing and anoxia. Here, we report on the amount, chemical composition and bioavailability of particulate (POM) and mineral-associated OM (MOM) in permafrost soils of the East Siberian Arctic. The average total organic carbon (OC) stock across all soils was 24.0 ± 6.7 kg m\textsuperscript{-2} within 100 cm soil depth. Density fractionation (density cut-off 1.6 g cm\textsuperscript{-3}) revealed that 54 ± 16\% of the total soil OC and 64 ± 18\% of OC in subsoil horizons was bound to minerals. As well as sorption of OM to clay-sized minerals (R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.80; P {$<$} 0.01), co-precipitation of OM with hydrolyzable metals may also transfer carbon into the mineral-bound fraction. Carbon:nitrogen ratios, stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes, \textsuperscript{13}C-NMR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that OM is transformed in permafrost soils, which is a prerequisite for the formation of mineral-organic associations. Mineral-associated OM in deeper soil was enriched in \textsuperscript{13}C and \textsuperscript{15}N, and had narrow C:N and large alkyl C:(O-/N-alkyl C) ratios, indicating an advanced stage of decomposition. Despite being up to several thousands of years old, when incubated under favourable conditions (60\% water-holding capacity, 15°C, adequate nutrients, 90 days), only 1.5-5\% of the mineral-associated OC was released as CO{$<$}inf{$>$}2{$<$}/inf{$>$}. In the topsoils, POM had the largest mineralization but was even less bioavailable than the MOM in subsoil horizons. Our results suggest that the formation of mineral-organic associations acts as an important additional factor in the stabilization of OM in permafrost soils. Although the majority of MOM was not prone to decomposition under favourable conditions, mineral-organic associations host a readily accessible carbon fraction, which may actively participate in ecosystem carbon exchange.},

  abstract = {In permafrost soils, the temperature regime and the resulting cryogenic processes are important determinants of the storage of organic carbon (OC) and its small-scale spatial variability. For cryoturbated soils, there is a lack of research assessing pedon-scale heterogeneity in OC stocks and the transformation of functionally different organic matter (OM) fractions, such as particulate and mineral-associated OM. Therefore, pedons of 28 Turbels were sampled in 5m wide soil trenches across the Siberian Arctic to calculate OC and total nitrogen (TN) stocks based on digital profile mapping. Density fractionation of soil samples was performed to distinguish between particulate OM (light fraction, LF, {$<$} 1.6 g cm−3), mineral associated OM (heavy fraction, HF, {$>$} 1.6 g cm−3), and a mobilizable dissolved pool (mobilizable fraction, MoF). Across all investigated soil profiles, the total OC storage was 20.2±8.0 kgm−2 (mean±SD) to 100cm soil depth. Fifty-four percent of this OC was located in the horizons of the active layer (annual summer thawing layer), showing evidence of cryoturbation, and another 35\% was present in the upper permafrost. The HF-OC dominated the overall OC stocks (55 \%), followed by LF-OC (19\% in mineral and 13\% in organic horizons). During fractionation, ap- proximately 13\% of the OC was released as MoF, which likely represents a readily bioavailable OM pool. Cryogenic activity in combination with cold and wet conditions was the principle mechanism through which large OC stocks were se- questered in the subsoil (16.4±8.1 kgm−2; all mineral B, C, and permafrost horizons). Approximately 22\% ofthe subsoil OC stock can be attributed to LF material subducted by cryoturbation, whereas migration of soluble OM along freezing gradients appeared to be the principle source ofthe dominant HF (63 \%) in the subsoil. Despite the unfavourable abiotic conditions, low C/N ratios and high δ13C values indicated substantial microbial OM transformation in the subsoil, but this was not reflected in altered LF and HF pool sizes. Partial least-squares regression analyses suggest that OC accumulates in the HF fraction due to co-precipitation with multiva- lent cations (Al, Fe) and association with poorly crystalline iron oxides and clay minerals. Our data show that, across all permafrost pedons, the mineral-associatedOM represents the dominant OM fraction, suggesting that the HF-OC is the OM pool in permafrost soils on which changing soil conditions will have the largest impact.},

  abstract = {© 2018 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd. Climate change in Arctic ecosystems fosters permafrost thaw and makes massive amounts of ancient soil organic carbon (OC) available to microbial breakdown. However, fractions of the organic matter (OM) may be protected from rapid decomposition by their association with minerals. Little is known about the effects of mineral-organic associations (MOA) on the microbial accessibility of OM in permafrost soils and it is not clear which factors control its temperature sensitivity. In order to investigate if and how permafrost soil OC turnover is affected by mineral controls, the heavy fraction (HF) representing mostly MOA was obtained by density fractionation from 27 permafrost soil profiles of the Siberian Arctic. In parallel laboratory incubations, the unfractionated soils (bulk) and their HF were comparatively incubated for 175 days at 5 and 15°C. The HF was equivalent to 70 ± 9\% of the bulk CO 2 respiration as compared to a share of 63 ± 1\% of bulk OC that was stored in the HF. Significant reduction of OC mineralization was found in all treatments with increasing OC content of the HF (HF-OC), clay-size minerals and Fe or Al oxyhydroxides. Temperature sensitivity (Q10) decreased with increasing soil depth from 2.4 to 1.4 in the bulk soil and from 2.9 to 1.5 in the HF. A concurrent increase in the metal-to-HF-OC ratios with soil depth suggests a stronger bonding of OM to minerals in the subsoil. There, the younger 14 C signature in CO 2 than that of the OC indicates a preferential decomposition of the more recent OM and the existence of a MOA fraction with limited access of OM to decomposers. These results indicate strong mineral controls on the decomposability of OM after permafrost thaw and on its temperature sensitivity. Thus, we here provide evidence that OM temperature sensitivity can be attenuated by MOA in permafrost soils.},

  abstract = {This paper reports on a purposive survey study which aimed to identify needs for the development, delivery and evaluation of applied climate education for targeted groups, to improve knowledge and skills to better manage under variable climatic conditions. The survey sample consisted of 80 producers and other industry stakeholders in Australia ( including representatives from consulting, agricultural extension and agricultural education sectors), with a 58\% response rate to the survey. The survey included an assessment of (i) knowledge levels of the Southern Oscillation Index and sea surface temperatures, and (ii) skill and ability in interpreting weather and climate parameters. Results showed that despite many of the respondents having more than 20 years experience in their industry, the only formal climate education or training undertaken by most was a 1-day workshop. Over 80\% of the applied climate skills listed in the survey were regarded by respondents as essential or important, but only 42\% of educators, 30\% of consultants and 28\% of producers rated themselves as competent in applying such skills. Essential skills were deemed as those that would enable respondents or their clients to be better prepared for the next extended wet or dry meteorological event, and improved capability in identifying and capitalising on key decision points from climate information and a seasonal climate outlook. The complex issue of forecast accuracy is a confounding obstacle for many in the application of climate information and forecasts in management. Addressing this problem by describing forecast 'limitations and skill' can help to overcome this problem. The survey also highlighted specific climatic tactical and strategic information collated from grazing, cropping and agribusiness enterprises, and showed the value of such information from a users perspective.

Spa- tial implementation of the models suggest lateral redistribution pro- cesses resulting in differential accumulation of C and soil mass in convergent and divergent landscape positions.

  abstract = {A longstanding assumption of glucose tracing experiments is that all glucose is microbially utilized during short incubations of ≤2 days to become microbial biomass or carbon dioxide. Carbon use efficiency (CUE) estimates have consequently ignored the formation of residues (non-living microbial products) although such materials could represent an important sink of glucose that is prone to stabilization as soil organic matter. We examined the dynamics of microbial residue formation from a short tracer experiment with frequent samplings over 72 h, and conducted a meta-analysis of previously published glucose tracing studies to assess the generality of these experimental results. Both our experiment and meta-analysis indicated 30–34\% of amended glucose-C (13C or 14C) was in the form of residues within the first 6 h of substrate addition. We expand the conventional efficiency calculation to include residues in both the numerator and denominator of efficiency, thereby deriving a novel metric of the potential persistence of glucose-C in soil as living microbial biomass plus residues (‘carbon stabilization efficiency'). This new metric indicates nearly 40\% of amended glucose-C persists in soil 180 days after amendment, the majority as non-biomass residues. Starting microbial biomass and clay content emerge as critical factors that positively promote such long term stabilization of labile C. Rapid residue production supports the conclusion that non-growth maintenance activity can illicit high demands for C in soil, perhaps equaling that directed towards growth, and that residues may have an underestimated role in the cycling and sequestration potential of C in soil.},

  abstract = {Using pre-established trial sites on allophanic soils, we investigated the impacts of long to medium-term pastoral management practices, such as fertilisation and grazing intensity, on a range of soil biological and biochemical properties; hot water-extractable C (HWC), water-soluble C (WSC), hot-water extractable total carbohydrates, microbial biomass-C and N and mineralisable N. These properties were examined for their usefulness as soil quality indicators responding to changes in the rhizosphere caused by management practices. Adjacent cropping, market garden and native bush sites located on similar soil types were included to determine the changes in soil biological and biochemical properties resulting from changes in land use. The seasonal variability of HWC and its relationship with other labile fractions of soil organic matter was also examined. Microbial biomass-C, mineralisable N and extractable total carbohydrates showed promise in differentiating treatment and land use effects. However, HWC was one of the most sensitive and consistent indicators examined at 52 different sites. The impact of different land uses on the amounts of HWC in the same soil type was far greater than that was observed for the soil organic carbon. The average values of HWC for soil under different land use were: native (4000 μg C g-1 soil), sheep/beef pastures (3400), dairy pastures (3000), cropping (1000) and market gardening soils (850). HWC was also sensitive to differences within an ecosystem, e.g. effects of grazing intensities and effects of N or P fertilisers on pastures. The sheep and beef/cattle grazed pastures always had higher amounts of HWC than the intensively grazed dairy pastures. Nitrogen fertiliser application (200 and 400 kg N ha-1 yr-1) over the previous 5 yr had significant (P {$<$} 0.001) negative impacts on HWC and other soil microbial properties. In contrast, long-term application of P fertilisers had a significant (P {$<$} 0.001) positive effect on the HWC levels in pastoral soils. In the case of long-term P trials, HWC increased even though no increase in the total soil carbon pool was detected. HWC was positively correlated with soil microbial biomass-C (R2 = 0.84), microbial nitrogen (R2 = 0.72), mineralisable N (R2 = 0.86), and total carbohydrates (R2 = 0.88). All these correlations were significant at P {$<$} 0.001 level of significance. The HWC was also positively correlated with WSC and total organic C. However, these correlations were poorer than those found for other soil parameters. Most of these measurements have been actively promoted as key indicators of soil quality. Given the strong correlations between HWC and other biochemical measurements, HWC could be used as an integrated measure of soil quality. When HWC is extracted, other pools of labile nutrients are also extracted along with C. Therefore it is suggested that decline in HWC would also indicate a decline in other labile organic pools of nutrients such as nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus. About 40-50\% of the C in the HWC extract was present as carbohydrates. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, interpreting temperature-F S relationships, and so modelling terrestrial carbon balance in a warmer world, is complicated by the many sources of respired carbon that contribute to F S (ref.) and a poor understanding of how temperature influences SOC decomposition rates. Here we quantified F S, litterfall, bulk SOC and SOC fraction size and turnover, and total below-ground carbon flux (TBCF) across a highly constrained 5.2 °C mean annual temperature (MAT) gradient in tropical montane wet forest. From these, we determined that: increases in TBCF and litterfall explain {$>$}90\% of the increase in F S with MAT; bulk SOC and SOC fraction size and turnover rate do not vary with MAT; and increases in TBCF and litterfall do not influence SOC storage or turnover on century to millennial timescales. This gradient study shows that for tropical montane wet forest, long-term and whole-ecosystem warming accelerates below-ground carbon processes with no apparent impact on SOC storage.© 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  abstract = {Accounting for CO2 fluxes by determining changes in stocks of soil carbon (C) as a result of land use change is an option for complying nations under the Kyoto Protocol. The 1996 IPCC guidelines for C accounting recommend that soil C stocks to a depth of 30 cm be used in such accounting. However, the soil bulk density often changes with land use and the soil C per unit ground area to a fixed depth will also change even without any change in the mass fraction of C in dry soil. This problem will generally arise when soil C accounting is taken to a fixed depth (i.e. uses 'spatial coordinates'). For accuracy in determining the land use change effects on soil C, soil sampling should be referred to a fixed dry soil mass per unit ground area (i.e. use 'cumulative mass coordinates'). There has been intermittent literature-discussion about this issue over several decades. Methods to accomplish C accounting on a mass coordinate basis, none of them accurate or efficient, have been suggested. Here, we propose a simple, accurate methodology for determining soil C stocks using cumulative mass coordinates, which does not involve repeat sampling trips, nominal specification of the location of boundaries between soil horizons, or independent sampling for determining soil bulk densities. Each core is taken a little (say 10 cm) below the nominal mass/depth required and the retrieved core is sliced into two at a point a little above the nominal mass/depth (say 10 cm above). An accurate determination of the depth of the core or slice is not needed, but an accurate determination of the dry mass of soil above and below the slice-point is required. Linear interpolation between these two measurements is then used to estimate the cumulative soil C per unit ground area to the target dry soil mass per unit ground area. Even though this method eliminates the need for reporting soil bulk densities for C accounting, it is urged that the bulk densities and density changes still be routinely reported. This is because such information is of fundamental importance for understanding and predicting the movement of fluids and substances carried in them within the soil and between the soil and the environment. Hence, these data are likely to be of fundamental importance in developing our future understanding and predictive capacity of soil C changes with land use change.},

Another invasive invertebrate, a weevil (Barypeithes pellucidus) also appeared to consume significant amounts of roots or root-derived C. High isotope enrichment in ants (Formicidae) may reflect their feeding on phloem-sucking coccids in soil. All the predators collected from the litter layer also exhibited high isotope enrichment, including the salamander Plethodon cinereus. Moreover, in the absence of invasive earthworms all the taxa of animals collected from surface soil were similarly highly-enriched in root-derived isotopes.

Currently, most experiments regarding soil C dynamics are conducted ex-situ (laboratory) and can fail to account for key variables (e.g. temperature and soil water content) which vary in-situ. In addition, ex-situ experiments are often highly invasive, e.g. severing root and mycorrhizal networks, changing the input and concentrations of low MW exudates within soil. The aim of this study was to directly compare the mineralization rates of 31 common low MW C substrates under ex- and in-situ conditions. In addition, we also assessed the inter-annual field variability of substrate mineralization rates. We added trace concentrations of 31 individual 14C-labelled common low MW C substrates into the top soil of an agricultural grassland and monitored the mineralization rates by capturing 14CO 2 evolved from the soil over 7 d. Our results showed that the contribution of low MW C components to soil respiration was highly reproducible between parallel studies performed either in-situ or ex-situ. We also found that differences in the mineralization of individual compounds were more variable inter-annually in the field than between the laboratory and the field. Our results suggest that laboratory-based C mineralization data can be used to reliably parameterize C models but that multiple experimental measurements should be made over time to reduce uncertainty in model parameter estimation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The flow of carbon (C) through soil is inherently complex due to the many thousands of different chemical transformations occurring simultaneously within the soil microbial community. The accurate modelling of this C flow therefore represents a major challenge. In response to this, isotopic tracers (e.g. 13C, 14C) are commonly used to experimentally parameterise models describing the fate and residence time of individual C compounds within soil. In this study, we critically evaluated the combined use of experimental 14C labelling and mathematical modelling to estimate C turnover times in soil. We applied 14C-labelled alanine and glucose to an agricultural soil and simultaneously measured their loss from soil solution alongside the rate of microbial C immobilization and mineralization. Our results revealed that chloroform fumigation-extraction (CFE) cannot be used to reliably quantify the amount of isotopically labelled 13C/14C immobilised by the microbial biomass. This is due to uncertainty in the extraction efficiency values (kec) within the CFE methodology which are both substrate and incubation time dependent. Further, the traditional mineralization approach (i.e. measuring 14/13CO2 evolution) provided a poor estimate of substrate loss from soil solution and mainly reflected rates of internal microbial C metabolism after substrate uptake from the soil. Therefore, while isotope addition provides a simple mechanism for labelling the microbial biomass it provides limited information on the behaviour of the substrate itself. We used our experimental data to construct a new empirical model to describe the simultaneous flow of substrate-C between key C pools in soil. This model provided a superior estimate of microbial substrate use and microbial respiration flux in comparison to traditional first order kinetic modelling approaches. We also identify a range of fundamental problems associated with the modelling of isotopic-C in soil, including issues with variation in C partitioning within the community, model pool connectivity and variation in isotopic pool dilution, which make interpretation of any C isotopic flux data difficult. We conclude that while convenient, the use of isotopic data (13C, 14C, 15N) has many potential pitfalls necessitating a critical evaluation of both past and future studies.},

  abstract = {Current attempts to explain the persistence of carbon in soils focuses on explanations such as the recalcitrant plant residues and the physical isolation of substrates from decomposers. A pool of organic matter that can persist for centuries to millennia is hypothesized because of the evidence provided by the persistence of pre-disturbance C in fallow or vegetation change experiments, and the radiocarbon age of soil carbon. However, new information, which became available through advances in the ability to measure the isotope signatures of specific compounds, favors a new picture of organic matter dynamics. Instead of persistence of plant-derived residues like lignin in the soil, the majority of mineral soil is in molecules derived from microbial synthesis. Carbon recycled multiple times through the microbial community can be old, decoupling the radio- carbon age of C atoms from the chemical or biological lability of the molecules they comprise. In consequence is soil microbiology, a major control on soil carbon dynamics, which highlights the potential vulnerability of soil organic matter to changing environmental condi- tions. Moreover, it emphasizes the need to devise new management options to restore, increase, and secure this valuable resource.},

Archive functioning relies on the chronological integrity of the respective units. Incorporation of younger organic matter (OM) e.g. by plant roots and associated microorganisms into deep subsoil and underlying soil parent material may reduce reliability of paleoenvironmental records and stability of buried OM. Long-term effects of sedimentary characteristics and deep rooting on deep subsoil microbial communities remain largely unknown. We characterized fossil and living microbial communities based on molecular markers in a Central European Late Pleistocene loess-paleosol sequence containing recent and ancient roots with ages of several millenia. The molecular approach, comprising free and phospholipid fatty acids (FAs), core and intact polar glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs), as well as 16S rRNA genes from bacterial DNA, revealed the presence of living microorganisms along the sequence, with bacterial community composition comparable to that of modern topsoils. Up to 88\% redundancy between bacterial genetic fingerprint and molecular signature of fossil microorganisms suggested a time-integrated signal of the molecular markers accumulated over a time span potentially lasting from sedimentation over one or more rooting phases until today. Free FAs, core GDGTs and DNA, considered as remains of fossil microorganisms, corresponded with ancient and recent root quantities, whereas phospholipid FAs and intact polar GDGTs, presumably derived from living microorganisms, correlated only with living roots. The biogeochemical and ecological disequilibrium induced by postsedimentary rooting may entail long-term microbial processes like OM mineralization, which may continue even millenia after the lifetime of the root. Deep roots and their fossil remains have been observed in various terrestrial settings, and roots as well as associated microorganisms cause both, OM incorporation and mineralization. Therefore, these findings are crucial for improved understanding of OM dynamics and carbon sequestration potential in deep subsoils.},

Previous studies on this topic generally focused on a single variable involved in the SOC stock calculation (SOC concentration, sampling depth, bulk density and rock fragment content) or on a single scale, rather than using an integrated approach (i.e. taking into account interactions between variables). This study aims to apply such an approach to identify and quantify the uncertainties in SOC stock assessments for different scales and spatial landscape units (LSU) under agriculture. The error propagation method (delta method) was used to quantify the relative contribution of each variable and interaction involved to the final SOC stock variability. Monte Carlo simulations were used to cross-check the results. Both methods converged (r2=0.78). As expected, the coefficient of variation of the SOC stock increased across scales (from 5 to 35\%), and was higher for grassland than for cropland. Although the main source of uncertainty in the SOC stock varied according to the scale and the LSU considered, the variability of SOC concentration (due to errors from the laboratory and to the high SOC spatial variability) and of the rock fragment content were predominant. When assessing SOC stock at the landscape scale, one should focus on the precision of SOC analyses from the laboratory, the reduction of SOC spatial variability (using bulk samples, accurate re-sampling, high sampling density or stratified sampling), and the use of equivalent masses for SOC stock comparison. The regional SOC stock monitoring of agricultural soils in southern Belgium allows the detection of an average SOC stock change of 20\% within 11 years if very high rates of SOC stock changes occur (1 t C ha-1 year-1).},

Soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics are regulated by a complex interplay of drivers. Climate, generally represented by temperature and moisture, is regarded as one of the fundamental controls. Here, we use 54 forest sites in Switzerland, systematically selected to span near-independent gradients in temperature and moisture, to disentangle the effects of climate, soil properties, and landform on SOC dynamics. We estimated two SOC turnover times, based on bulk soil 14C measurements (τ14C) and on a 6-month laboratory soil incubation (τi). In addition, upon incubation, we measured the 14C signature of the CO2 evolved and quantified the cumulated production of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Our results demonstrate that τi and τ14C capture the dynamics of contrasting fractions of the SOC continuum. The 14C-based τ14C primarily reflects the dynamics of an older, stabilised pool, whereas the incubation-based τi mainly captures fresh readily available SOC. Mean site temperature did not raise as a critical driver of SOC dynamics, and site moisture was only significant for τi. However, soil pH emerged as a key control of both turnover times. The production of DOC was independent of τi and not driven by climate, but primarily by the content of clay and, secondarily by the slope of the site. At the regional scale, soil physicochemical properties and landform appear to override the effect of climate on SOC dynamics.}

Wines and both fractions were in-mouth evaluated by a trained sensory panel and UPLC-MS analyses were performed. The lack of ethanol and proanthocyanidins greatly increased the acidity perceived. The elimination of organic acids enabled the description of the samples, which were evaluated as bitter, persistent and slightly astringent. Coutaric acid and quercetin-3-O-rutinoside appear to be relevant astringent compounds in the absence of proanthocyanidins. Bitter taste was highly correlated with the in-mouth persistence. A significant predictive model for bitter taste was built by means of PLSR.

A closed-chamber, dynamic sampling system was used to collect monthly cumulative samples of soil-respired CO 2 . The CO 2 collected at the mixed forest site was enriched in 14 C with respect to European free-atmosphere continental 14 CO 2 background (high-altitude station Jungfraujoch in Swiss Alps) by approximately 40\%, while the urban site revealed 14 C depletion by ∼30\% against the same reference. The Δ 14 C values observed at the agricultural site were lying in between, clustering along the regional reference atmospheric Δ 14 CO 2 trend curve. The Δ 14 C values of soil-respired CO 2 at the urban site turned out to be indistinguishable from the Δ 14 CO 2 values in the local atmosphere. For the estimation of mean turnover time of soil carbon for each of the monitored sites, we used a multicompartment model (MCM) accounting for input of carbon to the soil profile via deposition of fresh organic matter, as well as 3 different sources of CO 2 in the soil profile: 1) root respiration; 2) “fast”; and 3) “slow” pools of soil carbon. The estimated mean turnover time of carbon in the “fast” carbon pool was ∼14 yr for both urban grassland and mixed forest sites, and ∼22 yr for the cultivated agricultural field. From the observed differences in Δ 14 C values of the measured fluxes of soil-respired CO 2 , we conclude that 14 C content of the biogenic component in the local atmospheric CO 2 is site-specific and may differ significantly from the regional atmospheric background Δ 14 CO 2 value. Therefore, the assumption widely used in 14 C-based assessments of the fossil-fuel contribution local atmospheric CO 2 load, stating that 14 C concentration in the biogenic CO 2 component is equal to that of regional atmospheric reference value, needs to be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case basis.},

Precipitation (P) increased with elevation to \$\textbackslash sim\$500 m, and more gradually at higher elevations, while vegetation graded from savanna at 405 m to evergreen oak and pine forest to mid-montane forest to subalpine forest at 2700 m. CO {$<$}inf{$>$}2{$<$}/inf{$>$} uptake and transpiration at 405 m peaked in spring (March to May) and declined in summer; gas exchange at 1160 and 2015 m continued year-round; gas exchange at 2700 m peaked in summer and ceased in winter. A phenological threshold occurred between 2015 and 2700 m, associated with the development of winter dormancy. Annual ET and Gross Primary Production were greatest at 1160 and 2015 m and reduced at 405 m coincident with less P, and at 2700 m coincident with colder temperatures. The large decline in ET above 2015 m raises the possibility that an upslope redistribution of vegetation with climate change could cause a large increase in upper elevation ET. We extrapolated ET to the entire basin using remote sensing. The 2003-11 P for the entire Upper Kings River basin was 984 mm y\textsuperscript{-1} and the ET was 429 mm y\textsuperscript{-1}, yielding a P-ET of 554 mm y\textsuperscript{-1}, which agrees well with the observed Kings River flow of 563 mm y\textsuperscript{-1}.

The topographic wetness index (TWI) has become a widely used tool to describe wetness conditions at the catchment scale. With this index, however, it is assumed that groundwater gradients always equal surface gradients. To overcome this limitation, we suggest deriving wetness indices based on simulations of distributed catchment models. We compared these new indices with the TWI and evaluated the different indices by their capacity to predict spatial patterns of saturated areas. Results showed that the model-derived wetness indices predicted the spatial distribution of wetlands significantly better than the TWI. These results encourage the use of a dynamic distributed hydrological model to derive wetness index maps for hydrological landscape analysis in catchments with topographically driven groundwater tables. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we use example soilscapes from throughout California to examine how lithology, climate, topography, and duration of pedogenesis interact to produce distinctive weathering environments and characteristic suites of soil minerals. Seven soil-geomorphic sequences were assembled from the literature to illustrate major soil mineralogical trends: 1) granitic terrain of the Peninsular Ranges, 2) granitic terrain of the central Sierra Nevada, 3) andesitic terrain of the northern Sierra Nevada, 4) fluvial terraces on the east side of the Great Valley, 5) marine terraces of the central coast, 6) ultramafic terrain of the Klamath Mountains, and 7) an alluvial fan in the Mojave Desert. Results of this analysis show that kaolin is present in virtually all pedons, irrespective of climate, parent material, age, or topographic position. Kaolin does not form in ultramafic soils due to insufficient aluminum. Many secondary clay minerals reflect the state's strong climatic influence, with palygorskite, smectite, and vermiculite in the dry, hot environments; hydroxy-interlayered minerals, gibbsite, and short range-ordered minerals in the cool, moist environments. In arid and semi-arid regions, the distribution of calcite, gypsum, and soluble salts is strongly related to patterns of eolian dust deposition and water infiltration and leaching. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This allows for the systematic comparison of meteoric 10Be concentration to other soil characteristics and the comparison of profile depth distributions between geologic settings. Percent clay, 9Be, and dithionite-citrate extracted Al positively correlate to meteoric 10Be in more than half of the soils where they were measured, but the lack of significant correlation in other soils suggests that no one soil factor controls meteoric 10Be distribution with depth. Dithionite-citrate extracted Fe and cation exchange capacity are only weakly correlated to meteoric 10Be. Percent organic carbon and pH are not significantly related to meteoric 10Be concentration when all data are complied.The compilation shows that meteoric 10Be concentration is seldom uniform with depth in a soil profile. In young or rapidly eroding soils, maximum meteoric 10Be concentrations are typically found in the uppermost 20cm. In older, more slowly eroding soils, the highest meteoric 10Be concentrations are found at depth, usually between 50 and 200cm. We find that the highest measured meteoric 10Be concentration in a soil profile is an important metric, as both the value and the depth of the maximum meteoric 10Be concentration correlate with the total measured meteoric 10Be inventory of the soil profile.In order to refine the use of meteoric 10Be as an estimator of soil erosion rate, we compare near-surface meteoric 10Be concentrations to total meteoric 10Be soil inventories. These trends are used to calibrate models of meteoric 10Be loss by soil erosion. Erosion rates calculated using this method vary based on the assumed depth and timing of erosional events and on the reference data selected. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

As a result, the molecular characteristics of soil C are now known for a range of ecosystems, soil types, and management intensities. Placing this knowledge into a broader ecological and management context is difficult, however, and remains one of the fundamental challenges of soil organic matter research. Here we present a conceptual model of molecular soil C dynamics to stimulate inter-disciplinary research into the ecological implications of molecular C turnover and its management- and process-level controls. Our model describes three properties of soil C dynamics: 1) soil size fractions have unique molecular patterns that reflect varying degrees of biological and physical control over decomposition; 2) there is a common decomposition sequence independent of plant inputs or other ecosystem properties; and 3) molecular decomposition sequences, although consistent, are not uniform and can be altered by processes that accelerate or slow the microbial transformation of specific molecules. The consequences of this model include several key points. First, lignin presents a constraint to decomposition of plant litter and particulate C ({$>$} 53 μm) but exerts little influence on more stable mineral-associated soil fractions {$<$} 53 μm. Second, carbon stabilized onto mineral fractions has a distinct composition related more to microbially processed organic matter than to plant-related compounds. Third, disturbances, such as N fertilization and tillage, which alter decomposition rates, can have "downstream effects"; that is, a disturbance that directly alters the molecular dynamics of particulate C may have a series of indirect effects on C stabilization in silt and clay fractions. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Soil organic matter dynamics following land-use change remain difficult to predict because of the complex biological, physical, and chemical mechanisms that control C turnover. We examined twelve sites, representing four broad land-use types (cultivated agriculture, pine forest, hardwood forest, and pasture), in the South Carolina Piedmont to determine whether variation in organic matter chemistry was linked to management, soil edaphic properties, microbial communities, or labile C. Organic matter chemistry was determined before and after a 232-d incubation using pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy and microbial community properties were determined prior to incubation by measuring extracellular enzyme activities, fungal:bacterial ratios by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and microbial biomass. There was considerable variation in soil organic matter chemistry among the 12 sites but this could not be attributed to broad differences in land use, per se, likely because of the variation in edaphic soil properties and specific management practices within the individual land use categories. The relative abundance of N-containing compounds was correlated with the size of the labile C pool (r = 0.65). Further, the three most abundant N-containing pyrolysis products, pyridine, pyrrole, and indole, were also positively correlated with at least two enzymes and both pyridine and pyrrole were negatively correlated with fungal:bacterial ratios. In contrast, the relative abundances of lignin derivatives were often negatively correlated with enzyme activities but positively correlated with fungal:bacterial ratios. Post-incubation, silt plus clay content was negatively correlated with lignin derivatives (r = - 0.68) and positively correlated with N-containing compounds (r = 0.69). Our results suggest that broad land use categories are a poor predictor of soil organic matter chemistry when edaphic soil properties and specific management practices vary. However, enzyme activities, fungal:bacterial ratios, and soil texture correlate with soil organic matter chemistry across a range of ecosystems, suggesting that interactions between microbial communities and soil organic matter chemistry are important controls on soil C dynamics across landscapes. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Addressing concerns about future food supply and climate change requires management practices that maximize productivity per unit of arable land while reducing negative environmental impact. On-farm data were evaluated to assess energy balance and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of irrigated maize in Nebraska that received large nitrogen (N) fertilizer (183 kg of N · ha(-1)) and irrigation water inputs (272 mm or 2,720 m(3) ha(-1)). Although energy inputs (30 GJ · ha(-1)) were larger than those reported for US maize systems in previous studies, irrigated maize in central Nebraska achieved higher grain and net energy yields (13.2 Mg · ha(-1) and 159 GJ · ha(-1), respectively) and lower GHG-emission intensity (231 kg of CO(2)e · Mg(-1) of grain). Greater input-use efficiencies, especially for N fertilizer, were responsible for better performance of these irrigated systems, compared with much lower-yielding, mostly rainfed maize systems in previous studies. Large variation in energy inputs and GHG emissions across irrigated fields in the present study resulted from differences in applied irrigation water amount and imbalances between applied N inputs and crop N demand, indicating potential to further improve environmental performance through better management of these inputs. Observed variation in N-use efficiency, at any level of applied N inputs, suggests that an N-balance approach may be more appropriate for estimating soil N(2)O emissions than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change approach based on a fixed proportion of applied N. Negative correlation between GHG-emission intensity and net energy yield supports the proposition that achieving high yields, large positive energy balance, and low GHG emissions in intensive cropping systems are not conflicting goals.},

Simulations of 14C and 13C in the ocean and terrestrial components of Earth system models (ESMs) present opportunities for model evaluation and for investigation of carbon cycling, including anthropogenic CO2 emissions and uptake. The use of carbon isotopes in novel evaluation of the ESMs' component ocean and terrestrial biosphere models and in new analyses of historical changes may improve predictions of future changes in the carbon cycle and climate system. We compile existing data to produce records of 14C and 13C in atmospheric CO2 for the historical period 1850-2015. The primary motivation for this compilation is to provide the atmospheric boundary condition for historical simulations in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) for models simulating carbon isotopes in the ocean or terrestrial biosphere. The data may also be useful for other carbon cycle modelling activities.},

We estimated that the soils of England and Wales contained 1633, 1143 and 506Tg of OC at 0-30, 30-100 and 100-150cm depths, respectively. Thus, half of the soil OC was found below 30cm depth. Peat soils accounted for the largest proportion, containing 44\% of all the OC below 30cm despite their small areal extent, followed by brown soils, surface-water gley soils, ground-water gley soils and podzolic soils. Peat soils had more than 25\% of their profile OC per unit area in the 100-150cm depth, whereas most other soils had {$<$}8\% at this depth. The differences between soil types were consistent with differences in soil formation processes. Differences in depth distributions between land uses were small, but subsoil OC stocks in cultivated soils were generally smaller than in soils under grassland or other land uses. Data on subsoil OC stocks in the literature were scarce, but what there was broadly agreed with the findings of the above database exercise. There was little evidence by which to assess how subsoil OC stocks were changing over time.},

  abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (N) contents are controlled partly by plant inputs that can be manipulated in agricultural systems. Although SOC and N pools occur mainly in the topsoil (upper 0.30 m), there are often substantial pools in the subsoil that are commonly assumed to be stable. We tested the hypothesis that contrasting long-term management systems change the dynamics of SOC and N in the topsoil and subsoil (to 0.75 m) under temperate conditions. We used an established field experiment in the UK where control grassland was changed to arable (59 years before) and bare fallow (49 years before) systems. Losses of SOC and N were 65 and 61\% under arable and 78 and 74\% under fallow, respectively, in the upper 0.15 m when compared with the grass land soil, whereas at 0.3-0.6-m depth losses under arable and fallow were 41 and 22\% and 52 and 35\%, respectively. The stable isotopes 13C and 15N showed the effects of different treatments. Concentrations of long-chain n-alkanes C27, C29 and C31 were greater in soil under grass than under arable and fallow. The dynamics of SOC and N changed in both topsoil and subsoil on a decadal time-scale because of changes in the balance between inputs and turnover in perennial and annual systems. Isotopic and geochemical analyses suggested that fresh inputs and decomposition processes occur in the subsoil. There is a need to monitor and predict long-term changes in soil properties in the whole soil profile if soil is to be managed sustainably. HIGHLIGHTS: Land-use change affects soil organic carbon and nitrogen, but usually the topsoil only is considered.Grassland cultivated to arable and fallow lost 13-78\% SOC and N to 0.6 m depth within decades.Isotopic and biomarker analyses suggested changes in delivery and turnover of plant-derived inputs.The full soil profile must be considered to assess soil quality and sustainability.},

  abstract = {Spatial estimates of tropical soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations and stocks are crucial to understanding the role of tropical SOC in the global carbon cycle. They also allow for spatial variation of SOC in environmental process models. SOC is spatially highly variable. In traditional approaches, SOC concentrations and stocks have been derived from estimates for single or very few profiles and spatially linked to existing units of soil or vegetation maps. However, many existing soil profile data are incomplete and untested as to whether they are representative or unbiased. Also single means for soil or vegetation map units cannot characterize SOC spatial variability within these units. We here use the digital soil mapping approach to predict the spatial distribution of SOC. This relies on a soil inference model based on spatially referenced environmental layers of topographic attributes, soil units, parent material, and forest history. We sampled soils at 165 sites, stratified according to topography and lithology, on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, at depths of 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm, 20-30 cm, and 30-50 cm, and analyzed them for SOC by dry combustion. We applied Random Forest (RF) analysis as a modeling tool to the SOC data for each depth interval in order to compare vertical and lateral distribution patterns. RF has several advantages compared to other modeling approaches, for instance, the fact that it is neither sensitive to overfitting nor to noise features. The RF-based digital SOC mapping approach provided SOC estimates of high spatial resolution and estimates of error and predictor importance. The environmental variables that explained most of the variation in the topsoil (0-10 cm) were topographic attributes. In the subsoil (10-50 cm), SOC distribution was best explained by soil texture classes as derived from soil mapping units. The estimates for SOC stocks in the upper 30 cm ranged between 38 and 116 Mg ha- 1, with lowest stocks on midslope and highest on toeslope positions. This digital soil mapping approach can be applied to similar landscapes to refine the spatial resolution of SOC estimates. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Ground air-dried samples collected regularly using a 16 × 16-km grid were analysed for total (dry combustion) and inorganic (calcimeter) carbon; organic carbon was calculated by difference. Calibrations of MIR spectra with partial least square regressions were developed with 10-80\% of the set and five random selections of samples. Comparisons between samples with contrasting organic or inorganic carbon content and regression coefficients of calibration equations both showed that organic carbon was firstly associated with a wide spectral region around 2500-3500 cm -1 (which was a reflection of its complex nature), and inorganic carbon with narrow spectral bands, especially around 2520 cm -1. Optimal calibrations for both organic and inorganic carbon were achieved by using 20\% of the total set: predictions were not improved much by including more of the set and were less stable, probably because of atypical samples. At the 20\% rate, organic carbon predictions over the validation set (80\% of the total) yielded mean R 2, standard error of prediction (SEP) and RPD (ratio of standard deviation to SEP) of 0.89, 6.7 g kg -1 and 3.0, respectively; inorganic carbon predictions yielded 0.97, 2.8 g kg -1 and 5.6, respectively. This seemed appropriate for large-scale soil inventories and mapping studies but not for accurate carbon monitoring, possibly because carbonate soils were included.

Marked seasonal changes wcrc observed in the variability and frequency distributions of dcnitrification rates. Dcnitrification rates showed lower variance in spring and fall compared to summer, regardless of the magnitude of the rates. These patterns may be related to seasonal changes in soil structure, carbon availability or aeration, which create a more uniform environment in the spring and fall. The characteristic relationship bctwccn denitrification rates and soil texture and drainage over two seasons and multiple sites suggests that geomorphologically models using these parameters may be feasible for producing landscape- and regional-scale estimates of deni\&fication.},

  abstract = {Riparian zones have been found to function as "sinks" for nitrate (NO3-), the most common groundwater pollutant in the U. S., in many areas. The vast majority of riparian research, however, has focused on agricultural watersheds. There has been little analysis of riparian zones in urban watersheds, despite the fact that urban areas are important sources of NO3- to nitrogen (N)-sensitive coastal waters in many locations. In this study, we measured stream incision, water table depths, and pools, production (mineralization, nitrification), and consumption (denitrification) of NO3- in urban soils. Samples were taken from soil profiles (0-100 cm) of three forested urban and suburban zones and one forested reference riparian zone in the Baltimore, Maryland metropolitan area. Our objectives were to determine (1) if stream incision associated with urbanization results in lower riparian water tables, and (2) if pools, production, and consumption of NO3- vary systematically with stream incision and riparian water table levels. Two of the three urban and suburban streams were more incised and all three had lower water tables in their riparian zones than the forested reference stream. Urban and suburban riparian zones had higher NO3- pools and nitrification rates than the forested reference riparian zone, which was likely due to more aerobic soil profiles, lower levels of available soil carbon, and greater N enrichment in the urban and suburban sites. At all sites, denitrification potential decreased markedly with depth in the soil profile. Lower water tables in the urban and suburban riparian zones thus inhibit interaction of groundwater-borne NO3- with near surface soils that have the highest denitrification potential. These results suggest that urban hydrologic factors can increase the production and reduce the consumption of NO3- in riparian zones, reducing their ability to function as sinks for NO3- in the landscape.},

  abstract = {Denitrification, the reduction of the nitrogen (N) oxides, nitrate (NO3 ) and nitrite (NO2\$\textbackslash sim\$), to the gases nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), and dinitrogen (N2), is important to primary production, water quality, and the chemistry and physics of the atmosphere at ecosystem, landscape, regional, and global scales. Unfortunately, this process is very difficult to measure, and existing methods are problematic for different reasons in different places at different times. In this paper, we review the major approaches that have been taken to measure denitrification in terrestrial and aquatic environments and discuss the strengths, weaknesses, and future prospects for the different methods. Methodological approaches covered include (1) acetylene-based methods, (2) 15N tracers, (3) direct N2 quantification, (4) N2:Ar ratio quantification, (5) mass balance approaches, (6) stoichiometric approaches, (7) methods based on stable isotopes, (8) in situ gradients with atmospheric environmental tracers, and (9) molecular approaches. Our review makes it clear that the prospects for improved quantification of denitrification vary greatly in different environments and at different scales. While current methodology allows for the production of accurate estimates of denitrification at scales relevant to water and air quality and ecosystem fertility questions in some systems (e.g., aquatic sediments, well-defined aquifers), methodology for other systems, especially upland terrestrial areas, still needs development. Comparison of mass balance and stoichiometric approaches that constrain estimates of denitrification at large scales with point measurements (made using multiple methods), in multiple systems, is likely to propel more improvement in denitrification methods over the next few years},

  abstract = {Most of our terrestrial carbon (C) storage occurs in soils as organic C derived from living organisms. Therefore, the fate of soil organic C (SOC) in response to changes in climate, land use, and management is of great concern. Here we provide a unified conceptual model for SOC cycling by gathering the available information on SOC sources, dissolved organic C (DOC) dynamics, and soil biogeochemical processes. The evidence suggests that belowground C inputs (from roots and microorganisms) are the dominant source of both SOC and DOC in most ecosystems. Considering our emerging understanding of SOC protection mechanisms and long-term storage, we highlight the present need to sample (often ignored) deeper soil layers. Contrary to long-held biases, deep SOC—which contains most of the global amount and is often hundreds to thousands of years old—is susceptible to decomposition on decadal timescales when the environmental conditions under which it accumulated change. Finally, we discuss the vulnerability of SOC in different soil types and ecosystems globally, as well as identify the need for methodological standardization of SOC quality and quantity analyses. Further study of SOC protection mechanisms and the deep soil biogeochemical environment will provide valuable information about controls on SOC cycling, which in turn may help prioritize C sequestration initiatives and provide key insights into climate-carbon feedbacks.},

DSMM studies are diverse with specialized, mathematical prototype models tested on limited geographic regions and/or datasets and simpler, operational DSMM used for routine mapping over large soil regions. Research-focused DSMM contrasts with need-driven DSMM and agency-operated soil surveys. Since there is no universal equation or digital soil prediction model that fits all regions and purposes the proposed strategy is to characterize recent DSMM approaches to provide recommendations for future needs at local, national and global scales. Such needs are not solely soil-centered, but consider broader issues such as land and water quality, carbon cycling and global climate change, sustainable land management, and more. A literature review was conducted to review 90 DSMM publications from two high-impact international soil science journals - Geoderma and Soil Science Society of America Journal. A selective approach was used to identify published studies that cover the multi-factorial DSMM space. The following criteria were used (i) soil properties, (ii) sampling setup, (iii) soil geographic region, (iv) spatial scale, (v) distribution of soil observations, (vi) incorporation of legacy/historic data, (vii) methods/model type, (viii) environmental covariates, (ix) quantitative and pedological knowledge, and (x) assessment method. Strengths and weaknesses of current DSMM, their potential to be operationalized in soil mapping/modeling programs, research gaps, and future trends are discussed. Modeling of soils in 3D space and through time will require synergistic strategies to converge environmental landscape data and denser soil datasets. There are needs for more sophisticated technologies to measure soil properties and processes at fine resolution and with accuracy. Although there are numerous quantitative models rooted in factorial models that predict soil properties with accuracy in select geographic regions they lack consistency in terms of environmental input data, soil properties, quantitative methods, and evaluation strategies. DSMM requires merging of quantitative, geographic and pedological expertise and all should be ideally in balance. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this study, we fractionated NOM into hydrophobic (HbA) and hydrophilic (HL) subcomponents and two size fractions (with nominal molecular weights cut off at 3000 (3 K) dalton in an attempt to elucidate the adsorption and desorption mechanisms of NOM on iron oxide surfaces. Results indicated that, on a C weight basis, larger size HbA fraction was preferentially adsorbed (with a higher adsorption affinity and capacity) over smaller size HL fraction. However, on an 0 weight basis, less HbA fraction was adsorbed relative to the HL fraction, because HbA contained about 1.34 times more C but 0.82 times less 0 than the HL. These observations are consistent with results which indicate that only limited adsorption sites are available on the iron oxide surfaces and that the mechanism of HbA and HL adsorption was dominated by surface complexation-ligand exchange. FTIR and NMR spectroscopy and studies with several substituted benzoic acids/phenols further indicated that carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups of these NOM frac- tions were actively involved in the reactions, and the steric arrangement of these functional groups may have played an important role in determining the adsorption of NOM fractions. Desorption studies indicated that the adsorbed NOM macromolecules on iron oxide surfaces were strongly bound at a given pH and ionic composition, resulting in a strong adsorption-desorption hysteresis. One possible explanation for the observed hysteresis is that the solution composition and equilibria are not identical between adsorption and desorption phases of the experiment because of preferential or selective adsorption of certain NOM frac- tions. This study implies that, due to the polydispersity of NOM, the competitive and fractional adsorption- desorption of NOM subcomponents must be considered in order to better predict NOM partitioning between the solution and solid phases and, therefore, the transport behavior of NOM in the subsurface soil envi- ronment.},

Long-term bare fallows offer a unique opportunity to isolate the stable organic pool of soils and study its properties. We investigated the vulnerability of the stable organic C pool to fresh organic matter inputs by comparing the mineralization in a long-term bare fallow soil with that of an adjacent arable soil, containing stable C as well as more labile C. For this, we amended or not the soil samples with two different 13C-labelled fresh organic matter (straw or cellulose). In all cases we found a positive priming effect (i.e. an increased mineralization of soil organic carbon) when fresh organic matter was added. By comparing the results obtained on both soils, we estimated that half of the " primed" C in the arable soil due to straw addition as fresh organic matter, originated from the stable C pool. Our results suggest that under such conditions, which frequently occur, the stable pool of soil organic matter may largely contribute to soil extra-CO 2 emissions due to priming effect. Consequently, the C storage potential of this pool may be modified by changes in land use and/or biomass production that might change the priming of the mineralization of the stable pool of soil organic carbon. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Several studies underlined the quantitative importance of this deep soil organic carbon (SOC) pool and models are needed to better understand this stock and its evolution under climate and land-uses changes. In this study, we tested and compared three simple theoretical models of vertical transport for SOC against SOC profiles measurements from a long-term bare fallow experiment carried out by the Central-Chernozem State Natural Biosphere Reserve in the Kursk Region of Russia. The transport schemes tested are diffusion, advection and both diffusion and advection. They are coupled to three different formulations of soil carbon decomposition kinetics. The first formulation is a first order kinetics widely used in global SOC decomposition models; the second one, so-called "priming" model, links SOC decomposition rate to the amount of fresh organic matter, representing the substrate interactions. The last one is also a first order kinetics, but SOC is split into two pools. Field data are from a set of three bare fallow plots where soil received no input during the past 20, 26 and 58 yr, respectively. Parameters of the models were optimised using a Bayesian method. The best results are obtained when SOC decomposition is assumed to be controlled by fresh organic matter (i.e., the priming model). In comparison to the first-order kinetic model, the priming model reduces the overestimation in the deep layers. We also observed that the transport scheme that improved the fit with the data depended on the soil carbon mineralisation formulation chosen. When soil carbon decomposition was modelled to depend on the fresh organic matter amount, the transport mechanism which improved best the fit to the SOC profile data was the model representing both advection and diffusion. Interestingly, the older the bare fallow is, the lesser the need for diffusion is, suggesting that stabilised carbon may not be transported within the profile by the same mechanisms than more labile carbon.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {During the last decade, research in sedimentary systems led to the paradigm of sorptive stabilization of organic matter (OM). Studies on soils also show that sorptive interactions between dissolved organic matter (DOM) and mineral phases contribute to the preservation of soil OM. In the first part of the paper, we summarize evidence for sorptive stabilization of OM in forest soils including (a) pronounced retention of DOM in most subsoils, (b) strong chemisorptive binding exhibiting strong hysteresis, and (c) similarity in the composition of DOM and OM in illuvial soil horizons and clay-sized separates. However, the capacity of soils for sorption of DOM is not infinite. In the second part of the paper, we present a case study where we relate the yearly retention of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the mineral soil to the available sorption capacity of seven forest soils. We estimate that the saturation of the sorption complex would occur within 4-30 years. Assuming these soils are in steady-state equilibrium with respect to carbon cycling, this suggests a mean residence time of the sorbed organic carbon (OC) of about the same time, therefore providing little evidence for a long-term stabilization of sorbed OM. One explanation for this discrepancy may be because in forest soils most surfaces are not characterized by juvenile minerals but are covered with OM and colonized by microorganisms. This is the case mainly in topsoil horizons but occurs also along preferential flow paths and on aggregate surfaces. Biofilms develop particularly at sites receiving high input of nutrients and organic substrates, i.e., DOM, such as preferential flow paths. The OM input enhances the heterotrophic activity in the biofilm, converting the DOM into either organic compounds by microbial resynthesis or inorganic mineralization products. Recent studies suggest that Fe hydrous oxides embedded within the biofilms may serve as a sorbent and shuttle for dissolved organic compounds from the surrounding aqueous media. We assume that sorption of DOM to the biofilm does not lead to a stabilization of OM but is a prerequisite for its rapid turnover. Only when DOM is transported by mass flow or diffusion to fresh, juvenile mineral surfaces, may sorption effectively stabilize OM. This stabilization would involve complexation of functional groups, changed conformation, and incalation in small pores. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The purpose of our study was to determine how various soil decomposition and chemistry characteristics relate to soil organic matter (SOM) temperature sensitivity. We accomplished this objective using long-term soil incubations at three temperatures (15, 25, and 35 degrees C) and pyrolysis molecular beam mass spectrometry (py-MBMS) on 12 soils from 6 sites along a mean annual temperature (MAT) gradient (2-25.6 degrees C). The Q(10) values calculated from the CO(2) respired during a long-term incubation using the Q(10-q) method showed decomposition of the more resistant fraction to be more temperature sensitive with a Q(10-q) of 1.95 +/- 0.08 for the labile fraction and a Q(10-q) of 3.33 +/- 0.04 for the more resistant fraction. We compared the fit of soil respiration data using a two-pool model (active and slow) with first-order kinetics with a three-pool model and found that the two and three-pool models statistically fit the data equally well. The three-pool model changed the size and rate constant for the more resistant pool. The size of the active pool in these soils, calculated using the two-pool model, increased with incubation temperature and ranged from 0.1 to 14.0\% of initial soil organic C. Sites with an intermediate MAT and lowest C/N ratio had the largest active pool. Pyrolysis molecular beam mass spectrometry showed declines in carbohydrates with conversion from grassland to wheat cultivation and a greater amount of protected carbohydrates in allophanic soils which may have lead to differences found between the total amount of CO(2) respired, the size of the active pool, and the Q(10-q) values of the soils.},

It is presently believed that lignin is not selectively preserved in soil and that chemically labile compounds bonding to minerals comprise a large fraction of the SOM. Labile plant inputs have been suggested to be the main precursor of the mineral-bonded SOM. Litter decomposition and SOM formation are expected to have temperature sensitivity varying with the lability of plant inputs. We tested this framework using dual 13 C and 15 N differentially labeled plant material to distinguish the metabolic and structural components within a single plant material. Big Bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) seedlings were grown in an enriched 13 C and 15 N environment and then prior to harvest, removed from the enriched environment and allowed to incorporate natural abundance 13 C-CO 2 and 15 N fertilizer into the metabolic plant components. This enabled us to a chieve a greater than one atom \% difference in 13 C between the metabolic and structural components within the plant litter. This differentially labeled litter was incubated in soil at 15 and 35 °C, for 386 days with CO 2 measured throughout the incubation. After 14, 28, 147, and 386 days of incubation, the soil was subsequently fractionated. There was no difference in temperature sensitivity of the metabolic and structural components with regard to how much was respired or in the amount of litter biomass stabilized. Only the metabolic litter component was found in the sand, silt, or clay fraction while the structural component was exclusively found in the light fraction. These results support the stabilization framework that labile plant components are the main precursor of mineral-associated organic matter.},

The formation of SOM and the degree to which it is protected from decomposition are important for determining the long-term persistence of SOM. We used soils collected in a 13C-labelled litter decomposition study established at agricultural sites in Canada to understand the formation and persistence of newly-formed SOM. The ten agricultural sites spanned a wide range of soil carbon contents, texture, and climatic conditions. We fractionated the soil to isolate water extractable organic matter (WEOM), free light POM (fPOM), sand-sized and occluded particulate organic matter (oPOM), and silt and clay sized particles, referred to as mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM). Quantitative isotope tracing was used to determine the litter-derived C in all fractions. We performed these analyses early (six months after incubation) and later (five years after incubation) in the decomposition process to evaluate factors that control the formation and persistence of POM and MAOM. After six months litter-derived C was found in all fractions, but after five years it had declined in all fractions except the MAOM. Formation of MAOM was related to high mean annual precipitation and low sand content, whereas occluded POM formation was related to high soil C content. Persistence of MAOM and POM during the incubation were associated with low soil temperature and high soil C content. There was no consistent indication that formation of MAOM occurred from the decomposition of POM, suggesting that MAOM and POM are formed by two separate pathways. This has important implications for SOC models, which assume that plant-derived C passes through a sequence of pools, becoming more stable along the way.},

Due to the low organic mat-ter content in subsoil, microbial hotspots can improve nutrient availability to plants. Therefore, carbon (C) input of root biomass and rhizodeposition and the microbial utilization of root C by alfalfa and chicory, both deep-rooting taprooted preceding crops, was determined. Methods Three replicate plots of alfalfa and chicory grown on a Haplic Luvisol were 13 CO 2 pulse labeled after 110 days of growth. 13 C was traced in plant bio-mass, rhizosphere, bulk soil and in microbial biomass after 1 and 40 days. C stocks and δ 13 C signature were quantified in 15 cm intervals down to 105 cm depth. Results Alfalfa plant biomass was higher and root bio-mass was more homogeneously distributed between top-(0–30 cm) and subsoil (30–105 cm) compared to chicory. C input into subsoil by alfalfa, including roots and rhizodeposited C, was 8 times higher (3820 kg C ha −1) into subsoil compared to chicory after 150 days of growth. Microbial biomass in subsoil increased with alfalfa but decreased with chicory. Conclusions Despite their general ability to build biopores, taprooted preceding crops differ in creating microbial hotspots in subsoil. Higher C input and mi-crobial growth in subsoil under alfalfa cultivation can improve physico-chemical and biological properties, and so enhance root growth and consequently the water and nutrient uptake from subsoil compared to chicory.},

  abstract = {The aim of our study was to identify controls on initial dissolved organic matter (DOM) leaching from decomposing forest litter and to estimate how it is affected by increasing atmospheric CO2. Using microcosms, we measured initial C mineralization and leaching rates of DOC, DON and biodegradable DOC from litter of eight tree species from CO2 enrichment experiments in a 100 year-old broadleaf forest and a 30 year-old treeline ecosystem. Over 11 weekly leaching cycles, between 2.5\% (Pinus uncinata, Fagus sylvatica) and 15\% (Carpinus betulus) of litter C were leached as DOC, corresponding to 9-36\% of the total mass loss. Significantly less, 0.9\% (Pinus) to 4.5\% (Tilia platyphyllos) of litter N was leached as DON. Leaching of DOC was not correlated to C mineralization, which ranged between 12\% (Fagus) and 32\% (Tilia) of litter C. While C mineralization increased with decreasing litter C/N ratios and lignin contents, DOC leaching particularly the initially leached DOC was significantly related to concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) and phenolics. DOC leached after the third leaching cycle did not correlate with any of the measures of litter quality, but with the molar UV absorptivity of DOC, suggesting that DOC production is linked to lignin degradation. Previous CO2 enrichment increased NSC and phenolics in the litter and decreased lignin contents, which resulted in significantly greater initial C mineralization (+ 5 \%) and DOC leaching rates (+ 16 \%). However, these CO2 effects were only significant during the initial leaching phase and much smaller than the differences between tree species. Initially leached DOC was less biodegradable when its parent litter was grown under elevated than under ambient CO2 (38\% vs. 42\% of DOC across all species, P {$<$}0.05). Therefore, leaching of 'refractory' DOC was increased under elevated CO2, which will rather accelerate DOC inputs into mineral soils than further stimulate microbial activity. In summary, our study shows (1) that initial DOM leaching is controlled by other factors than C mineralization; and (2) that CO2 enrichment of forests can stimulate initial mineralization and leaching of C from litter by altering its quality, but these effects will be short-term and much smaller than any change in species composition. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The cycling of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soils is controversial. While DOM is believed to be a C source for soil microorganisms, DOM sorption to the mineral phase is regarded as a key stabilization mechanism of soil organic matter (SOM). In this study, we added \textsuperscript{14}C-labelled DOM derived from Leucanthemopsis alpina to undisturbed soil columns of a chronosequence ranging from initial unweathered soils of a glacier forefield to alpine soils with thick organic layers. We traced the \textsuperscript{14}C label in mineralized and leached DOM and quantified the spatial distribution of DO\textsuperscript{14}C retained in soils using a new autoradiographic technique. Leaching of DO\textsuperscript{14}C through the 10cm-long soil columns amounted up to 28\% of the added DO\textsuperscript{14}C in the initial soils, but to less than 5\% in the developed soils. Biodegradation hardly contributed to the removal of litter-DO\textsuperscript{14}C as only 2-9\% were mineralized, with the highest rates in mature soils. In line with the mass balance of \textsuperscript{14}C fluxes, measured \textsuperscript{14}C activities in soils indicated that the major part of litter DO\textsuperscript{14}C was retained in soils ({$>$}80\% on average). Autoradiographic images showed an effective retention of almost all DO\textsuperscript{14}C in the upper 3cm of the soil columns. In the deeper soil, the \textsuperscript{14}C label was concentrated along soil pores and textural discontinuities with similarly high \textsuperscript{14}C activities than in the uppermost soil. These findings indicate DOM transport via preferential flow, although this was quantitatively less important than DOM retention in soils. The leaching of DO\textsuperscript{14}C correlated negatively with oxalate-extractable Al, Fe, and Mn. In conjunction with the rapidity of DO\textsuperscript{14}C immobilization, this strongly suggests that sorptive retention DOM was the dominating pathway of litter-derived DOM in topsoils, thereby contributing to SOM stabilization.},

  abstract = {It has been proposed that the large soil carbon (C) stocks of humid tropical forests result predominantly from C stabilization by reactive minerals, whereas oxygen (O\textsubscript{2}) limitation of decomposition has received much less attention. We examined the importance of these factors in explaining patterns of C stocks and turnover in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico, using radiocarbon (\textsuperscript{14}C) measurements of contemporary and archived samples. Samples from ridge, slope, and valley positions spanned three soil orders (Ultisol, Oxisol, Inceptisol) representative of humid tropical forests, and differed in texture, reactive metal content, O\textsubscript{2} availability, and root biomass. Mineral-associated C comprised the large majority (87 ± 2\%, \emph{n} = 30) of total soil C. Turnover of most mineral-associated C (74 ± 4\%) was rapid (9 to 29 years, mean and SE 20 ± 2 years) in 25 of 30 soil samples across surface horizons (0–10 and 10–20 cm depths) and all topographic positions, independent of variation in reactive metal concentrations and clay content. Passive C with centennial – millennial turnover was much less abundant (26\%), even at 10–20 cm depths. Carbon turnover times and concentrations significantly increased with concentrations of reduced iron (Fe(II)) across all samples, suggesting that O\textsubscript{2} availability may have limited the decomposition of mineral associated C over decadal scales. Steady-state inputs of mineral-associated C were similar among the three topographic positions, and could represent 10–30\% of annual litterfall production (estimated by doubling aboveground litterfall). Observed trends in mineral-associated \&Delta;\textsuperscript{14}C over time could not be fit using the single pool model used in many other studies, which generated contradictory relationships between turnover and \&Delta;\textsuperscript{14}C as compared with a more realistic constrained two-pool model. The large C fluxes in surface and near-surface soils implied by our data suggest that other studies using single-pool \&Delta;\textsuperscript{14}C models of mineral-associated C dynamics, unconstrained by multiple time points, may have systematically underestimated C turnover.},

  abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) often increases with the abundance of short-range-ordered iron (SRO Fe) mineral phases at local to global scales, implying a protective role for SRO Fe. However, less is known about how Fe phase composition and crystal order relate to SOM composition and turnover, which could be linked to redox alteration of Fe phases. We tested the hypothesis that the composition and turnover of mineral-associated SOM co-varied with Fe phase crystallinity and abundance across a well-characterized catena in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico, using dense fractions from 30 A and B horizon soil samples. The δ13C and δ15N values of dense fractions were strongly and positively correlated (R2þinspace=þinspace0.75), indicating microbial transformation of plant residues with lower δ13C and δ15N values. However, comparisons of dense fraction isotope ratios with roots and particulate matter suggested a greater contribution of plant versus microbial biomass to dense fraction SOM in valleys than ridges. Similarly, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy indicated that SOM functional groups varied significantly along the catena. These trends in dense fraction SOM composition, as well as ∆14C values indicative of turnover rates, were significantly related to Fe phase crystallinity and abundance quantified with selective extractions. Mössbauer spectroscopy conducted on independent bulk soil samples indicated that nanoscale ordered Fe oxyhydroxide phases (nano-goethite, ferrihydrite, and/or very-SRO Fe with high substitutions) dominated (66–94\%) total Fe at all positions and depths, with minor additional contributions from hematite, silicate and adsorbed FeII, and ilmenite. An additional phase that could represent organic-FeIII complexes or aluminosilicate-bearing FeIII was most abundant in valley soils (17–26\% of total Fe). Overall, dense fraction samples with increasingly disordered Fe phases were significantly associated with increasingly plant-derived and faster-cycling SOM, while samples with relatively more-crystalline Fe phases tended towards slower-cycling SOM with a greater microbial component. Our data suggest that counter to prevailing thought, increased SRO Fe phase abundance in dynamic redox environments could facilitate transient accumulation of litter derivatives while not necessarily promoting long-term C stabilization.},

  abstract = {The molecular composition of soil organic carbon remains contentious. Microbial-, plant- and fire-derived compounds may each contribute, but whether they vary predictably among ecosystems remains unclear. Here we present carbon functional groups and molecules from a diverse spectrum of North American surface mineral soils, collected primarily from the National Ecological Observatory Network and quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and a molecular mixing model. We find that soils vary widely in relative contributions of carbohydrate, lipid, protein, lignin and char-like carbon, but each compound class has similar overall abundance. Ninety percent of the variance in carbon composition can be explained by three principal component axes representing a trade-off between lignin and protein, a trade-off between carbohydrate and char, and lipids. Reactive aluminium, crystalline iron oxides and pH plus overlying organic horizon thickness—predictors that are all related to climate—best explain variation along each respective axis. Together, our data point to continental-scale trade-offs in soil carbon molecular composition that are linked to environmental and geochemical variables known to predict carbon mass concentrations. Controversies regarding the genesis of soil carbon and its potential responses to global change can be partially reconciled by considering diverse ecosystem properties that drive complementary persistence mechanisms.},

A data synthesis was performed to summarize information available in the literature on the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration obtained in laboratory soil incubations and expressed as Q 10 . The influence of common experimental variables and methods, i.e. range of incubation temperatures, length of incubation, calculation methods, and amounts of soil organic carbon, was analyzed.We found a small but significant difference between the Q 10 values calculated with different experimental methods as well as time-related trends showing an initial decrease followed by stable values. Q 10 values ranged from 0.5 to over 300 and were negatively correlated with temperature, but only at the range of temperatures below 25 °C. A similar dependence of the activation energy (derived from the Arrhenius equation) with temperature was observed. A negative relationship with total organic carbon content of soils was found in forest and grassland ecosystems, with an average decrease in Q 10 of 0.02 mgC g -1 soil, explaining their slightly lower mean Q 10 s compared to cultivated soils. Because most of the observed variability remained unexplained, we emphasize the need for new approaches in future studies to the problem of understanding the temperature sensitivity of soil organic matter decomposition. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Global Change Biology Published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd Soil organic matter (SOM) supports the Earth's ability to sustain terrestrial ecosystems, provide food and fiber, and retains the largest pool of actively cycling carbon. Over 75\% of the soil organic carbon (SOC) in the top meter of soil is directly affected by human land use. Large land areas have lost SOC as a result of land use practices, yet there are compensatory opportunities to enhance productivity and SOC storage in degraded lands through improved management practices. Large areas with and without intentional management are also being subjected to rapid changes in climate, making many SOC stocks vulnerable to losses by decomposition or disturbance. In order to quantify potential SOC losses or sequestration at field, regional, and global scales, measurements for detecting changes in SOC are needed. Such measurements and soil-management best practices should be based on well established and emerging scientific understanding of processes of C stabilization and destabilization over various timescales, soil types, and spatial scales. As newly engaged members of the International Soil Carbon Network, we have identified gaps in data, modeling, and communication that underscore the need for an open, shared network to frame and guide the study of SOM and SOC and their management for sustained production and climate regulation.},

It plays a key role in many processes at the Earth surface, especially the fluxes of matter to soils, ecosystems, rivers, and oceans.

A new high resolution global lithological map (GLiM) was assembled from existing regional geological maps translated into lithological information with the help of regional literature. The GLiM represents the rock types of the Earth surface with 1,235,400 polygons. The lithological classification consists of three levels. The first level contains 16 lithological classes comparable to previously applied definitions in global lithological maps. The additional two levels contain 12 and 14 subclasses, respectively, which describe more specific rock attributes. According to the GLiM, the Earth is covered by 64\% sediments (a third of which are carbonates), 13\% metamorphics, 7\% plutonics, and 6\% volcanics, and 10\% are covered by water or ice. The high resolution of the GLiM allows observation of regional lithological distributions which often vary from the global average. The GLiM enables regional analysis of Earth surface processes at global scales. A gridded version of the GLiM is available at the PANGEA Database. © 2012. American Geophysical Union.

  abstract = {{$<$}abstract abstract-type="summary"{$>$} Current computer simulation models do not treat the physical protection of organic matter in soil mechanistically. A model is presented that describes physical protection explicitly as a function of the capacity of clay particles and aggregates to hold organic matter. The net rate of decomposition of organic matter depends not simply on soil texture but on the degree to which the protective capacity of the soil is already occupied. The rate at which organic matter becomes protected depends on both the amount of free organic matter and the degree to which the protective capacity is filled. The rate at which organic matter is released from protection depends only on the amount of protected organic matter. The model closely followed the buildup and decline of organic matter in 10 soils to which grass residues were added each year for a period of 10 yr and then left without addition for a further 10 yr. An estimate made with the model of the maximum capacity of each of these soils to protect organic matter was closely correlated with the clay fraction in the soils. With this model, we were better able to predict the buildup and decline in amounts of soil organic matter in soils of different textures and initial organic matter contents than with conventional, implicit descriptions of protection. Our model accounted for 80\% of the variance in the experimental data compared with 77 and 75\% using the other two models. Secondly and importantly, the capacity of soil to protect organic matter was found to be positively and well related with the clay content of the soil in our model, whereas similar relationships were not found between soil texture and the parameters controlling protection in the other models.},

Only studies that investigated the impacts of cover crops and measured one or a combination of nitrogen leaching, soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrous oxide (N2O), grain yield and nitrogen in grain of primary crop, and had a control treatment were included in the analysis. Long‐term studies were uncom‐ mon, with most data coming from studies lasting 2–3 years.

Our analysis demonstrates that cover crops significantly (p {$<$} 0.001) decreased N leaching and significantly (p {$<$} 0.001) increased SOC sequestration without having significant (p {$>$} 0.05) effects on direct N2O emissions. Cover crops could mitigate the NGHGB by 2.06 ± 2.10 Mg CO2‐eq ha−1 year−1. One of the potential disadvantages of cover crops identified was the reduction in grain yield of the primary crop by ≈4\%, compared to the control treatment. This drawback could be avoided by selecting mixed cover crops with a range of legumes and non‐legumes, which increased the yield by ≈13\%. These advantages of cover crops justify their widespread adoption. However, management practices in relation to cover crops will need to be adapted to specific soil, management and regional climatic conditions.},

  abstract = {Total soil organic matter content is a key attribute of soil quality since it has far-reaching effects on soil physical, chemical, and biological properties. However, changes in contents of organic carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N) occur only slowly and do not provide an adequate indication of important short-term changes in soil organic matter quality that may be occurring. Labile organic matter pools can be considered as fine indicators of soil quality that influence soil function in specific ways and that are much more sensitive to changes in soil management practice. Particulate organic matter consists of partially decomposed plant litter, and it acts as a substrate and center for soil microbial activity, a short-term reservoir of nutrients, a food source for soil fauna and loci for formation of water stable macroaggregates. Dissolved (soluble) organic matter consists of organic compounds present in soil solution. This pool acts as a substrate for microbial activity, a primary source of mineralizable N, sulfur (S), and phosphorus (P), and its leaching greatly influences the nutrient and organic matter content and pH of groundwater. Various extractable organic matter fractions have also been suggested to be important, including hot water-extractable and dilute acid-extractable carbohydrates, which are involved in stabilization of soil aggregates, and permanganate-oxidizable C. Measurement of potentially mineralizable C and N represents a bioassay of labile organic matter using the indigenous microbial community to release labile organic fractions of C and N. Mineralizable N is also an important indicator of the capacity of the soil to supply N for crops. It is concluded that individual labile organic matter fractions are sensitive to changes in soil management and have specific effects on soil function. Together they reflect the diverse but central effects that organic matter has on soil properties and processes. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The large amount of soil carbon in boreal forest ecosystems has the potential to influence the climate system if released in large quantities in response to warming. Thus, there is a need to better understand and represent the environmental sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition. Most soil carbon decomposition models rely on empirical relationships omitting key biogeochemical mechanisms and their response to climate change is highly uncertain. In this study, we developed a multi-layer microbial explicit soil decomposition model framework for boreal forest ecosystems. A thorough sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify dominating biogeochemical processes and to highlight structural limitations. Our results indicate that substrate availability (limited by soil water diffusion and substrate quality) is likely to be a major constraint on soil decomposition in the fibrous horizon (40–60\% of soil organic carbon (SOC) pool size variation), while energy limited microbial activity in the amorphous horizon exerts a predominant control on soil decomposition ({$>$}70\% of SOC pool size variation). Elevated temperature alleviated the energy constraint of microbial activity most notably in amorphous soils, whereas moisture only exhibited a marginal effect on dissolved substrate supply and microbial activity. Our study highlights the different decomposition properties and underlying mechanisms of soil dynamics between fibrous and amorphous soil horizons. Soil decomposition models should consider explicitly representing different boreal soil horizons and soil–microbial interactions to better characterize biogeochemical processes in boreal forest ecosystems. A more comprehensive representation of critical biogeochemical mechanisms of soil moisture effects may be required to improve the performance of the soil model we analyzed in this study.},

We used 14C data from 157 globally distributed soil profiles sampled to 1-meter depth to show that ESMs underestimated the mean age of soil carbon by a factor of more than six (430 ± 50 years versus 3100 ± 1800 years). Consequently, ESMs overestimated the carbon sequestration potential of soils by a factor of nearly two (40 ± 27\%).

  abstract = {Understanding soil carbon cycling is important for assessing ecosystem response to climate change. Temperate conifer forest soils contain a substantial portion of the global soil C pool and therefore are key components of the global carbon cycle. Despite the importance of temperate forest soil organic carbon (SOC) in the global carbon cycle, the mechanisms and dynamics of SOC accumulation and storage remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we sampled four soils over different bedrock types (rhyolite, granite, basalt, limestone) under Pinus ponderosa to explore the following questions: i) Within a specific ecosystem type, how do SOC contents vary among sites with differing mineralogy? ii) What physicochemical variables are most highly correlated with SOC content, soil microbial community composition and soil respiration? and iii) What mechanisms account for the influence of these variables on SOC cycling? Soil physiochemical and microbiological properties were characterized and compared on the basis of mineral assemblage, pH, organic carbon content, bacterial community composition, respiration rate, microbial biomass, specific metabolic activity (qCO2), and δ13C of respired CO2. The selected field sites spanned a physicochemical gradient, ranging from acid (pH of 5.2) to basic (pH of 7.1) from rhyolite to granite to basalt to limestone. The acidic rhyolite and granite soils had measurable amounts of exchangeable Al3+ (up to 3 cmol+ kg- 1). SOC content varied significantly among sites, ranging from 3.5 to 11 kg C m- 2.in limestone and rhyolite soils, respectively. Soil bacterial communities were also significantly different among all sites. Metal-humus complex and Fe-oxyhydroxide content emerged as important controllers of SOC dynamics across all sites, showing significant correlation with both SOC content (Al-humus: R2 = 0.71; P {$<$} 0.01; Fe-humus: R2 = 0.75; P {$<$} 0.001; crystalline FeOx: R2 = 0.63; P {$<$} 0.01) and bacterial community composition (Al-humus: R2 = 0.35; P {$<$} 0.05; Fe-humus: R2 = 0.51; P {$<$} 0.01; oxalate-extractable Fe: R2 = 0.59; P {$<$} 0.01). Moreover, soil pH was significantly correlated with exchangeable Al3+, metal-humus complex content, bacterial community composition, and microbial biomass C/N ratios. Results indicated that within a specific ecosystem, SOC dynamics and microbial community vary predictably with soil physicochemical variables directly related to mineralogical differences among soil parent materials. Specifically, the data suggest a gradient in the dominant SOC stabilization mechanism among sites, with chemical recalcitrance and metal-humus complexation the dominant control in soils of the acidic rhyolite and granite sites, and mineral adsorption the dominant factor in the basic limestone and basalt sites. Knowledge of parent material dependent SOC dynamics allows for improved estimates of ecosystem SOC stocks and the potential response of SOC to climate change. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Stabilization of SOM (soil organic matter) is regulated in part by sorption and desorption reactions happening at mineral surfaces, as well as precipitation and dissolution of organo-metal complexes. Fe and Al hydroxides play a particularly significant role in SOM stabilization in soils due to their ubiquitous distribution and their highly reactive surface properties. Iron and Al hydroxides exist in soils across a wide spectrum of crystallinity, ranging from dissolved Fe and Al cations which combine with organics to form organo-metal precipitates to the more crystalline end members, goethite and gibbsite, which sorb SOM through a variety of molecular interactions. Though the importance of these sorption and precipitation reactions has long been recognized, the distribution of SOM among Fe and Al hydroxides of differing crystallinity has not been well quantified, nor has the timescale over which these stabilization mechanisms operate. In an attempt to measure the distribution of organic C among (i) Al- and Fe-humus complexes (ii) short-range-order (SRO) Al and Fe hydroxide surfaces and (iii) crystalline Fe oxyhydroxide surfaces, a single method combining several selective mineral dissolutions was applied to soils of four different geneses (a tropical forest Andisol, a temperate forest basaltic Mollisol, a Mediterranean coastal prairie Mollisol, and a northern mixed hardwood forest Spodosol). The traditional reactants used in selective dissolutions were replaced with carbon-free analogues so that the carbon released along with the Fe and Al at each stage of the selective dissolution process could be measured. Selective dissolutions were performed sequentially: Na-pyrophosphate (organo-Al and Fe complexes) followed by hydroxylamine (SRO Al and Fe hydroxides) followed by dithionite-HCl (crystalline Fe hydroxides). Carbon, Al, and Fe concentrations, as well as radiocarbon abundance were measured in the solutions yielded by each stage of the selective dissolution process. Results suggest that precipitation of organo-metal complexes (Na-pyrophosphate extractable C) often accounts for the largest pool of stabilized C among the three selectively dissolved pools, but these complexes were 14 C enriched in comparison to C from the other selectively dissolved pools and the residual C left on crystalline mineral surfaces after all three stages of selective dissolution. Hydroxylamine and dithionite-HCl extractable C pools were, on average, small and often below detection level in temperate soils. However, radiocarbon values for these C pools were generally depleted in comparison to other pools. These results suggest variation in organo-mineral complex stability is associated with degree of crystallinity of the mineral phase. Overall, this work suggests that sequential selective dissolution methods are a promising tool for characterizing the content and isotopic composition of soil C associated with distinct organo-mineral and organo-metal associations.},

  abstract = {Understanding the controls on the amount and persistence of soil organic carbon (C) is essential for predicting its sensitivity to global change. The response may depend on whether C is unprotected, isolated within aggregates, or protected from decomposition by mineral associations. Here, we present a global synthesis of the relative influence of environmental factors on soil organic C partitioning among pools, abundance in each pool (mg C g−1 soil), and persistence (as approximated by radiocarbon abundance) in relatively unprotected particulate and protected mineral-bound pools. We show that C within particulate and mineral-associated pools consistently differed from one another in degree of persistence and relationship to environmental factors. Soil depth was the best predictor of C abundance and persistence, though it accounted for more variance in persistence. Persistence of all C pools decreased with increasing mean annual temperature (MAT) throughout the soil profile, whereas persistence increased with increasing wetness index (MAP/PET) in subsurface soils (30–176 cm). The relationship of C abundance (mg C g−1 soil) to climate varied among pools and with depth. Mineral-associated C in surface soils ({$<$}30 cm) increased more strongly with increasing wetness index than the free particulate C, but both pools showed attenuated responses to the wetness index at depth. Overall, these relationships suggest a strong influence of climate on soil C properties, and a potential loss of soil C from protected pools in areas with decreasing wetness. Relative persistence and abundance of C pools varied significantly among land cover types and soil parent material lithologies. This variability in each pool's relationship to environmental factors suggests that not all soil organic C is equally vulnerable to global change. Therefore, projections of future soil organic C based on patterns and responses of bulk soil organic C may be misleading.},

The efficacy of the Soil CMS model has been tested for assessing soil organic carbon stocks in a selected climate–land-use–soil grouping (cell). The cell selected for this test represents an area of 709 683 ha and contains soils with a high-activity clay mineralogy promoting long-term stabilisation of organic matter, and is under low-producing grassland in a dry temperate New Zealand climate. These soils have been sampled at randomly selected positions to assess total soil organic carbon stocks to 0.3 m, and to compare with the modelled value. Results show no significant difference between the field estimation (67 ± 30 Mg C/ha), the mean value of the model calibration dataset (79 ± 28 Mg C/ha), and the value predicted by the model (101 ± 41 Mg C/ha), although all estimates have large uncertainties associated with them. The model predicts national soil organic carbon stocks as a function of soil texture, clay mineralogy, land use, climate class, and a slope–rainfall erosivity product. Components of uncertainty within the model include the size and distribution of the calibration dataset, and lack of representativeness of the calibration soil samples, which were sampled for other reasons, e.g. soil survey and forest mensuration. Our study has shown that major components of uncertainty in our field estimation of soil organic carbon stocks (investigated using the indices reproducibility, RP; and coefficient of variation, CV) are short-range (within-plot) and regional (between-sites) spatial variability. Soil organic carbon stocks vary within our selected climate–land-use–soil cell due to varying stoniness (stony soils RP 44\%, CV 21\%; non-stony soils RP 27\%, CV 13\%), soil depth, slope position, and climatic effects. When one outlier soil was removed from the model calibration dataset, and the three very stony sites were removed from the randomly selected field validation set, the model calibration dataset and the field dataset means agreed well (78 ± 26 and 78 ± 21 Mg C/ha, respectively). The higher modelled value, before removal of the outlier, is likely to reflect a bias in the model dataset towards conventionally selected modal profiles containing less stony soils than those encountered by the random sampling strategy of our field campaign. Therefore, our results indicate (1) that the Soil CMS provides an adequate estimation of soil organic carbon for the selected cell, and (2) ongoing refinements are required to reduce the uncertainty of prediction.},

Our research deployed vehicle-mounted electromagnetic sensor survey equipment to map and quantify soil variability (˜50 ha per day) using apparent electrical conductivity as an indirect measure of soil texture and moisture differences. A portable visible–near infrared (VNIR) spectrometer (350–2500 nm) was then used in the field to acquire hyperspectral data from the side of soil cores to a specified depth at optimized sampling locations. The sampling locations were derived by statistical analysis of the electromagnetic survey dataset, to proportionally sample the full range of spatial variability. The VNIR spectra were used to predict soil organic carbon (prediction model using field-moist spectra: R2 = 0.39; RPD = 1.28; and air-dry spectra: R2 = 0.80; RPD = 2.25). These point values were combined with the electromagnetic survey data to produce a soil organic carbon map, using a random forest data mining approach (validation model: R2 = 0.52; RMSE = 3.21 Mg C/ha to 30 cm soil depth; prediction model: R2 = 0.92; RMSE = 1.53 Mg C/ha to 30 cm soil depth).

The objective of this study was to analyze the amounts and distribution of SOC and to elucidate the turnover and storage mechanisms throughout deep soil profiles of a sandy Dystric Cambisol on Pleistocene glacial deposits under beech forest in northern Germany. The soil was sampled within a grid design at three replicated profiles, each at 8 sampling depths (10, 35, 60, 85, 110, 135, 160, 185 cm) and 8 horizontal sampling points. 192 samples were analyzed for bulk density, texture, pH, SOC, total N, 13C-SOC, oxalate- and dithionite-extractable Fe and Al, root bio- and necromass, and microbial biomass C. For each sampling depth, a multi-effect model analysis was performed to identify the parameters explaining SOC variability. While SOC in the topsoil is only related to pH and dithionite-extractable Al, SOC in the subsoil is always related to root bio- and necromass and to Fe oxides and/or silt content. The comparison of SOC within rooted and root-free subsoil samples showed an up to 10 times higher SOC content in the rooted soil samples in comparison to the root-free samples. While the SOC content in the root-free soil declined with increasing depth the rooted soil samples showed no stratification with depth but were characterized by a higher spatial variability of SOC. At the same time, SOC in rooted soil samples has the same δ13C values as in root-free samples, indicating a similar degree of microbial processing. Microbial biomass C (Cmic) was not different between rooted and root-free samples, resulting in much higher Cmic:SOC ratios in the root-free soil. Since rooted soil samples are characterized by significantly higher silt and oxalate-extractable Fe (Feo) contents, it appears that roots preferentially grow into these chemically and physically slightly more favorable zones. At the same time, these higher inputs were apparently better stabilized through sorption to silt and metal oxyhydroxides, thus leading to the longer-term SOC sequestration in these hot-spots enhancing the spatial variability of SOC in subsoils.},

An accurate and stable weight loss was achieved after 2 h of burning pure CaCO3 at 950 °C, whereas LOI of pure graphite at 530 °C showed a direct relation to sample size and exposure time, with only 40-70\% of the possible weight loss reached after 2 h of exposure and smaller samples losing weight faster than larger ones. Experiments with a standardised lake sediment revealed a strong initial weight loss at 550 °C, but samples continued to lose weight at a slow rate at exposure of up to 64 h, which was likely the effect of loss of volatile salts, structural water of clay minerals or metal oxides, or of inorganic carbon after the initial burning of organic matter. A further test-run revealed that at 550 °C samples in the centre of the furnace lost more weight than marginal samples. At 950 °C this pattern was still apparent but the differences became negligible. Again, LOI was dependent on sample size. An analytical LOI quality control experiment including ten different laboratories was carried out using each laboratory's own LOI procedure as well as a standardised LOI procedure to analyse three different sediments. The range of LOI values between laboratories measured at 550 °C was generally larger when each laboratory used its own method than when using the standard method. This was similar for 950 °C, although the range of values tended to be smaller. The within-laboratory range of LOI measurements for a given sediment was generally small. Comparisons of the results of the individual and the standardised method suggest that there is a laboratory-specific pattern in the results, probably due to differences in laboratory equipment and/or handling that could not be eliminated by standardising the LOI procedure. Factors such as sample size, exposure time, position of samples in the furnace and the laboratory measuring affected LOI results, with LOI at 550 °C being more susceptible to these factors than LOI at 950 °C. We, therefore, recommend analysts to be consistent in the LOI method used in relation to the ignition temperatures, exposure times, and the sample size and to include information on these three parameters when referring to the method.},

  abstract = {The specific surface area (SSA) of soils is a basic property and closely related to other physical and chemical properties like e.g. cation exchange capacity, clay content, organic matter content, porosity and hydrodynamic and geotechnical characteristics. Therefore, the SSA of soils has been measured frequently for decades. However, no universal method to determine SSA exists. The existing methods can generally be grouped into two categories, the adsorption of gases and the adsorption of polar liquids or molecules from solution. Depending on the method applied, the SSA of a soil can vary, as by these different methods, different surfaces of the soil are determined. The most frequently used representatives of these two groups for measuring SSA of soils are the physisorption of nitrogen gas at 77K (BET-N2) for the gas adsorption methods, yielding the external surface area of the mineral particles, and the retention of ethylene glycol monoethyl ether (EGME) for the adsorption of polar liquids, probing the total surface area including interlayers of clay minerals and micropores of organic material. Studies dealing with the determination of SSA of soils are numerous, and it has also been shown that the resulting SSA values differ not only depending on the method but also on the sorbate used and the sample pretreatment. This review shortly presents the principles of these methods and emphasises their limitations and difficulties, when applied to soil samples, like sample pretreatment, (micro-)porosity and attachment of organic material to mineral surfaces. In particular the drying of the samples prior to measurement seems to be crucial for the results obtained. Recommendations are given in order to improve the quality of the data and to facilitate the comparability of SSA data of different studies. It is shown for clayey soil samples that the relationship between BET-N2 and EGME SSA depends predominantly on the type of clay mineral and not on the content of organic material. Thus, from the SSA measurements, an estimation of the dominant clay mineral seems possible. Consequently, a suitable combination of various SSA determination methods together with related techniques can result in a more detailed characterisation of the reactive interface of a soil to the liquid and gaseous phases. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Stable soil organic matter (SOM) is important for long-term sequestration of soil organic carbon (SOC), but the usefulness of different fractionation methods to isolate stable SOM is open to question. We assessed the suitability of five chemical fractionation methods (stepwise hydrolysis, treatment with H2O2, Na2S2O8, NaOCl, and demineralization of the NaOCl-resistant fraction (NaOCl + HF)) to isolate stable SOM from soil samples of a loamy sand and a silty loam under different land use regimes (grassland, forest and arable crops). The apparent C turnover time and mean age of SOC before and after fractionation was determined by 13C and 14C analysis. Particulate organic matter was removed by density fractionation before soils were exposed to chemical fractionation. All chemical treatments induced large SOC losses of 62201395\% of the mineral-associated SOC fraction. The amounts of H2O2- and Na2S2O8-resistant SOC were independent from land use, while those of NaOCl- (NaOCl + HF)- and hydrolysis-resistant SOC were not. All chemical treatments caused a preferential removal of young, maize-derived SOC, with Na2S2O8 and H2O2 being most efficient. The mean 14C age of SOC was 1000201310000 years greater after chemical fractionation than that of the initial, mineral-associated SOC and mean 14C ages increased in the order: NaOCl {$<$} NaOCl + HF 2264 stepwise hydrolysis 226A H2O22248 Na2S2O8. None of the methods appeared generally suitable for the determination of the inert organic matter pool of the Rothamsted Carbon Model. Nonetheless, our results indicate that all methods are able to isolate an older, more stable SOC fraction, but treatments with H2O2 and Na2S2O8 were the most efficient ones in isolating stable SOM.},

  abstract = {The balance between photosynthetic organic carbon production and respiration controls atmospheric composition and climate1,2. The majority of organic carbon is respired back to carbon dioxide in the biosphere, but a small fraction escapes remineralization and is preserved over geological timescales3. By removing reduced carbon from Earth's surface, this sequestration process promotes atmospheric oxygen accumulation2 and carbon dioxide removal1. Two major mechanisms have been proposed to explain organic carbon preservation: selective preservation of biochemically unreactive compounds4,5 and protection resulting from interactions with a mineral matrix6,7. Although both mechanisms can operate across a range of environments and timescales, their global relative importance on 1,000-year to 100,000-year timescales remains uncertain4. Here we present a global dataset of the distributions of organic carbon activation energy and corresponding radiocarbon ages in soils, sediments and dissolved organic carbon. We find that activation energy distributions broaden over time in all mineral-containing samples. This result requires increasing bond-strength diversity, consistent with the formation of organo-mineral bonds8 but inconsistent with selective preservation. Radiocarbon ages further reveal that high-energy, mineral-bound organic carbon persists for millennia relative to low-energy, unbound organic carbon. Our results provide globally coherent evidence for the proposed7 importance of mineral protection in promoting organic carbon preservation. We suggest that similar studies of bond-strength diversity in ancient sediments may reveal how and why organic carbon preservation—and thus atmospheric composition and climate—has varied over geological time.},

  abstract = {A methodological framework for spatial prediction based on regression-kriging is described and compared with ordinary kriging and plain regression. The data are first transformed using logit transformation for target variables and factor analysis for continuous predictors (auxiliary maps). The target variables are then fitted using step-wise regression and residuals interpolated using kriging. A generic visualisation method is used to simultaneously display predictions and associated uncertainty. The framework was tested using 135 profile observations from the national survey in Croatia, divided into interpolation (100) and validation sets (35). Three target variables: organic matter, pH in topsoil and topsoil thickness were predicted from six relief parameters and nine soil mapping units. Prediction efficiency was evaluated using the mean error and root mean square error (RMSE) of prediction at validation points. The results show that the proposed framework improves efficiency of predictions. Moreover, it ensured normality of residuals and enforced prediction values to be within the physical range of a variable. For organic matter, it achieved lower relative RMSE than ordinary kriging (53. 3\% versus 66.5\%). For topsoil thickness, it achieved a lower relative RMSE (66.5\% versus 83.3\%) and a lower bias than ordinary kriging (0.15 versus 0.69 cm). The prediction of pH in topsoil was difficult with all three methods. This framework can adopt both continuous and categorical soil variables in a semi-automated or automated manner. It opens a possibility to develop a bundle algorithm that can be implemented in a GIS to interpolate soil profile data from existing datasets. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

SoilGrids provides global predictions for standard numeric soil properties (organic carbon, bulk density, Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), pH, soil texture fractions and coarse fragments) at seven standard depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 100 and 200 cm), in addition to predictions of depth to bedrock and distribution of soil classes based on the World Reference Base (WRB) and USDA classification systems (ca. 280 raster layers in total). Predictions were based on ca. 150,000 soil profiles used for training and a stack of 158 remote sensing-based soil covariates (primarily derived from MODIS land products, SRTM DEM derivatives, climatic images and global landform and lithology maps), which were used to fit an ensemble of machine learning methods — random forest and gradient boosting and/or multinomial logistic regression — as implemented in the R packages ranger, xgboost, nnet and caret. The results of 10–fold cross-validation show that the ensemble models explain between 56 \% (coarse fragments) and 83 \% (pH) of variation with an overall average of 61 \%. Improvements in the relative accuracy considering the amount of variation explained, in comparison to the previous version of SoilGrids at 1 km spatial resolution, range from 60 to 230 \%. Improvements can be attributed to the use of machine learning instead of linear regression, to considerable investments in preparing finer resolution covariate layers and to insertion of additional soil profiles. Further development of SoilGrids could include refinement of methods to incorporate input uncertainties and derivation of posterior probability distributions (per pixel), and further automation of spatial modelling so that soil maps can be generated for potentially hundreds of soil variables. Another area of future research is the development of methods for multiscale merging of SoilGrids predictions with local and/or national gridded soil products (e.g. up to 50 m spatial resolution) so that increasingly more accurate, complete and consistent global soil information can be produced.

  abstract = {Forest soils are frequently subjected to dry wet cycles, but little is known about the effects of repeated drying and wetting and wetting intensity on fluxes of NH4+, NO3- and DOC. Here, undisturbed soil columns consisting of organic horizons (O columns) and organic horizons plus mineral soil (O+M columns) from a mature Norway spruce stand at the Fichtelgebirge; Germany, were repeatedly desiccated and subsequently wetted by applying different amounts of water (8, 20 and 50 mm day(-1)) during the initial wetting phase. The constantly moist controls were not desiccated and received 4 mm day(-1) during the entire wetting periods. Cumulative inorganic N fluxes of the control were 12.4 g N m(-2) (O columns) and 11.4 g N m(-2) (O+M columns) over 225 days. Repeated drying and wetting reduced cumulative NH4+ and NO3- fluxes of the O columns by 47-60 and 76-85\%, respectively. Increasing NH4+ (0.6-1.1 g N m(-2)) and decreasing NO3- fluxes (7.6-9.6 g N m(-2)) indicate a reduction in net nitrification in the O+M columns. The negative effect of dry-wet cycles was attributed to reduced net N mineralisation during both the desiccation and wetting periods. The soils subjected to dry-wet cycles were considerably drier at the final wetting period, suggesting that hydrophobicity of soil organic matter may persist for weeks or even months. Based on results from this study and from the literature we hypothesise that N mineralisation is mostly constrained by hydrophobicity in spruce forests during the growing season. Wetting intensity did mostly not alter N and DOC concentrations and fluxes. Mean DOC concentrations increased by the treatment from 45 mg 1(-1) to 61-77 mg 1(-1) in the O tlsbba columns and from 12 mg 1(-1) to 21-25 mg 1(-1) in the O+M columns. Spectroscopic properties of DOC from the O columns markedly differed within each wetting period, pointing to enhanced release of rather easily decomposable substrates in the initial wetting phases and the release of more hardly decomposable substrates in the final wetting phases. Our results suggest a small additional DOC input from organic horizons to the mineral soil owing to drying and wetting.},

Here, we test the hypothesis that freezing and thawing triggers N and dissolved organic matter (DOM) release from a forest soil after thawing and that low freezing temperatures enhance the effect. Undisturbed soil columns were taken from a soil at a Norway spruce site either comprising only O horizons or O horizons + mineral soil horizons. The columns were subjected to three cycles of freezing and thawing at temperatures of -3 degrees C, -8 degrees C, and -13 degrees C. The control columns were kept at constant +5 degrees C. Following the frost events, the columns were irrigated for 20 d at a rate of 4 mm d(-1). Percolates were analyzed for total N, mineral N, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The total amount of mineral N extracted from the O horizons in the control amounted to 8.6 g N m(-2) during the experimental period of 170 d. Frost reduced the amount of mineral N leached from the soil columns with -8 degrees C and -13 degrees C being most effective. In these treatments, only 3.1 and 4.0 g N m(-2) were extracted from the O horizons. Net nitrification was more negatively affected than net ammonification. Severe soil frost increased the release of DOC from the O horizons, but the effect was only observed in the first freeze-thaw cycle. We found no evidence for lysis of microorganisms after soil frost. Our experiment did not confirm the hypothesis that soil frost increases N mineralization after thawing. The total amount of additionally released DOC was rather low in relation to the expected annual fluxes.},

The increase lasted for about 2-4 months at a time of low seepage water fluxes. Soil frost did not affect DOC concentrations and radiocarbon signatures of DOC. No specific frost effect was observed for K(+), Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) in soil solutions, however, the Na(+) concentrations in the upper mineral soil increased.

  abstract = {Soil organic carbon (OC) storage across regions is influenced by climate and parent materials, which determine soil properties like clay content and mineralogy. Within homogeneous soil regions, land use and management practices are further important controls for soil OC contents and turnover. Here, we studied the impact of study region, land use (forest, grassland), forest management (spruce and beech forest under age-class management, unmanaged beech forest), and grassland management (meadow, mown pasture, unmown pasture) on stocks and turnover (based on ΔC values) of soil OC in density frations of topsoil horizons. Samples were taken from 36 plots in the regions Hainich-Dün (HAI) and the Schwäbische Alb (ALB) in Germany. They were separated into two light fractions (free light fraction (LF1), occluded light fraction (LF2)) and the mineral-associated organic matter (MOM) fraction using sodium polytungstate with a density of 1.6 g cm. Overall most soil OC was stored in the MOM fraction (73\%). Soil OC concentrations and stocks in the MOM fraction differed between study regions, probably due to larger amounts of pedogenic Al- and Fe-oxides in the ALB than in the HAI region. Within each region, forest soils stored significantly higher proportions of total OC in the two LF (33±1.9 \%) than grassland soils (20±2.3 \%). Different management of forests and grasslands affected the C:N ratio of density fractions, but not OC storage. While modelled soil OC turnover in the MOM was longest of all fractions, all fractions had average ΔC values above atmospheric values, suggesting a significant fast-cycling component in all of them. Different from stocks, turnover of OC in the MOM fraction were not affected by study region or contents of pedogenic oxides. Radiocarbon contents in the LF were higher for forest than for grassland sites, indicating faster turnover of OC at grassland sites. However, some of the observed difference could originate from different average lifetimes of roots in forests and grasslands. Applying different lag-times for OC input for forests and grasslands significantly reduced the differences in modelled turnover times. Lower ΔC values of mown pastures than pasture soils in both regions suggest a management effect on soil C turnover in grasslands.We conclude that OC storage in the MOM of topsoil layers is more affected by regional differences in soil texture and mineralogy than by land use and management, while its turnover could not be explained with the studied soil properties. Soil OC storage and turnover in the two LFs is influenced by land use (forest or grassland) and management, but ecosystem specific lag-times have to be considered for modelling OC turnover in these fractions.

  abstract = {Although environmental processes at large scales are to a great degree the resultant of processes at smaller scales, models representing these processes can vary considerably from scale to scale. There are three main reasons for this. Firstly, different processes dominate at different scales, and so different processes are ignored in the simplification step of the model development. Secondly, input data are often absent or of a much lower quality at larger scales, which results in a tendency to use simpler, empirical models at the larger scale. Third, the support of the inputs and outputs of a model changes with change of scale, and this affects the relationships between them. Given these reasons for using different models at different scales, application of a model developed at a specific scale to a larger scale should be treated with care. Instead, models should be modified to suit the larger scale, and for this purpose uncertainty analyses can be extremely helpful. If upscaling disturbed the balance between the contributions of input and model error to the output error, then an uncertainty analysis will show this. Uncertainty analysis will also show how to restore the balance. In practice, application of uncertainty analysis is severely hampered by difficulties in the assessment of input and model error. Knowledge of the short distance spatial variability is of paramount importance to input error assessment with a change of support, but current geographical databases rarely convey this type of information. Model error can only be estimated reliably by validation, but this is not easy because the support of model predictions and validation measurements is usually not the same.},

  abstract = {The soil mantles the land, except where there is bare rock or ice, and it varies more or less continuously. Many of its properties change continuously in time, too. We can measure the soil at only a finite number of places and times on small supports, and any statement concerning the soil at other places or times involves prediction. Variation in soil is also complex, so complex that no description of it can be complete, and so prediction is inevitably uncertain. Soil scientists should be able to quantify this uncertainty, and manage it. This means representing the variation by models that may be in part deterministic, but cannot be wholly so; they must have some random element to represent the unpredictable variation. Here we review three families of statistically based models of soil variation that are currently in use and trace their development since the mid-1960s. In particular, we consider classification and geostatistics for modelling the spatial variation, time series analysis and physically based approaches for modelling temporal variation, and space-time Kalman filtering for predicting soil conditions in space and time simultaneously. Each of these attaches to its predictions quantitative estimates of the prediction errors. Past, present and future research has been, is, and will be directed to the development of models that diminish these errors. A challenge for the future is to investigate approaches that merge process knowledge with measurements. For soil survey, this would be achieved by integration of pedogenetic knowledge and field observations through the use of data assimilation techniques, such as the space-time Kalman filter. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem respiration (Reco ) is one of the largest terrestrial carbon (C) fluxes. The effect of climate change on Reco depends on the responses of its autotrophic and heterotrophic components. How autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration sources respond to climate change is especially important in ecosystems underlain by permafrost. Permafrost ecosystems contain vast stores of soil C (1672 Pg) and are located in northern latitudes where climate change is accelerated. Warming will cause a positive feedback to climate change if heterotrophic respiration increases without corresponding increases in primary production. We quantified the response of autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration to permafrost thaw across the 2008 and 2009 growing seasons. We partitioned Reco using Δ(14) C and δ(13) C into four sources-two autotrophic (above - and belowground plant structures) and two heterotrophic (young and old soil). We sampled the Δ(14) C and δ(13) C of sources using incubations and the Δ(14) C and δ(13) C of Reco using field measurements. We then used a Bayesian mixing model to solve for the most likely contributions of each source to Reco . Autotrophic respiration ranged from 40 to 70\% of Reco and was greatest at the height of the growing season. Old soil heterotrophic respiration ranged from 6 to 18\% of Reco and was greatest where permafrost thaw was deepest. Overall, growing season fluxes of autotrophic and old soil heterotrophic respiration increased as permafrost thaw deepened. Areas with greater thaw also had the greatest primary production. Warming in permafrost ecosystems therefore leads to increased plant and old soil respiration that is initially compensated by increased net primary productivity. However, barring large shifts in plant community composition, future increases in old soil respiration will likely outpace productivity, resulting in a positive feedback to climate change.},

We present results of a decade-long field study that traced the decomposition of 13C- and 15N-labeled Pinus ponderosa needle and fine root litter placed in O or A soil horizons of a sandy Alfisol under a coniferous forest. We measured the retention of litter-derived C and N in particulate ({$>$}2 mm) and bulk soil ({$<$}2 mm) fractions, as well as in density-separated free light and three mineral-associated fractions. After 10 years, the influence of slower initial mineralization of root litter compared to needle litter was still evident: almost twice as much root litter (44\% of C) was retained than needle litter (22–28\% of C). After 10 years, the O horizon retained more litter in coarse particulate matter implying the crucial comminution step was slower than in the A horizon, while the A horizon retained more litter in the finer bulk soil, where it was recovered in organo-mineral associations. Retention in these A horizon mineral-associated fractions was similar for roots and needles. Nearly 5\% of the applied litter C (and almost 15\% of the applied N) was in organo-mineral associations, which had centennial residence times and potential for long-term stabilization. Vertical movement of litter-derived C was minimal after a decade, but N was significantly more mobile. Overall, the legacy of initial litter quality influences total SOM retention; however, the potential for and mechanisms of long-term SOM stabilization are influenced not by litter type but by soil horizon.},

  abstract = {Even though over half of the world's soil organic carbon (SOC) is stored in subsoils ({$>$}20 cm deep), and the old ages of subsoil OC indicate its cycling differs from surface SOC, there are few studies examining in situ decomposition processes in deep soils. Here, we added 13C-labeled fine roots to 15, 55, and 95 cm depths of a well-characterized coniferous forest Alfisol and monitored the amount of root-derived C remaining over 6, 12, and 30 months. We recovered the root-derived C in microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) after 6 months and in coarse ({$>$}2 mm) particulate, fine ({$<$}2 mm) particulate, and dense, mineral-associated pools after 6, 12, and 30 months. Overall, root decomposition in the first 6 months was similar among all depths but significantly diverged at 30 months with faster decomposition at 15 cm than at 95 cm. There were more fungal and Gram negative-associated PLFAs at 15 cm than at 95 cm, and 13C analysis revealed those microbial groups preferred the added root carbon to native SOC. Mineral-associations were not the cause of slower decomposition at depth because similar amounts of applied root C was recovered in the dense fraction at all depths. The largest difference among depths was in the amount of root C recovered in the coarse particulate fraction, which was greater at 95 cm (50\%) than at 15 cm (15\%). Slower decomposition of the particulate pool at depth likely contributed to the increase in C:N ratios and depletion of δ13C values below 60 cm depth in our soil profiles. Simulations of these soils using the CORPSE model, which incorporates microbial priming effects and mineral stabilization of SOC, reproduced patterns of particulate and mineral-associated SOC over both time and depth and suggested that a lack of priming by root exudates at depth could account for the slower decomposition rate of particulate root material. Decomposition of deep particulate SOC may increase if root exudation or dissolved OC transport to depth increases.},

  abstract = {The rate of organic matter turnover in soil is a critical component of the terrestrial carbon cycle and is frequently estimated from measurements of respiration. For estimates to be reliable requires that isotopically labelled substrate uptake into the soil microbial biomass and its subsequent mineralization occurs almost simultaneously (i.e. no time delay). Here we investigated this paradigm using glucose added to an agricultural soil. Immediately after collection from the field, various concentrations of 14C-labeled glucose (1 μM to 10 mM) were added to soil and the depletion from the soil solution measured at 1-60 min after substrate addition. 14CO2 production from the mineralization of glucose was simultaneously measured. The microbial uptake of glucose from soil solution was concentration-dependent and kinetic analysis suggests the operation of at least two distinct glucose transport systems of differing affinity. At glucose concentrations reflecting those naturally present in the soil solution (54±10 μM), the half-time (t1/2) of exogenous glucose was extremely rapid at ca. 30 s. At higher glucose concentrations (100 μM to 10 mM), the t1/2 values for the high-affinity carrier were altered little, but increasing proportions of glucose were taken up by the low affinity transport system. Glucose mineralization by the soil microbial community showed a significant delay after its uptake into the microbial biomass suggesting a decoupling of glucose uptake and subsequent respiration, possibly by dilution of glucose in labile metabolite pools. By fitting a double first order kinetic equation to the mineralization results we estimated the t1/2 for the first rapid phase of respiration at natural soil solution glucose concentrations to be 6-8 min, but at least 87\% of the added glucose was retained in the microbial biomass prior to mineralization. Our results suggest that in this soil the soil solution glucose pool turns over 100-1000 times each day, an order of magnitude faster than when determined from measurements of mineralization. These results imply that traditional isotopic based measurements of substrate turnover measured using CO2 may vastly underestimate their rate of cycling in soil. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Consequently, choice of fertilizer type, optimizing fertilizer application rates and timing, reducing microbial denitrification and improving soil carbon management are focus areas for mitigation. We have integrated separate models derived from global data on fertilizer-induced soil N2O emissions, soil nitrification inhibitors, and the effects of tillage and soil inputs of soil C stocks into a single model to determine optimal mitigation options as a function of soil type, climate, and fertilization rates. After Monte Carlo sampling of input variables, we aggregated the outputs according to climate, soil and fertilizer factors to consider the benefits of several possible emissions miti- gation strategies, and identified the most beneficial option for each factor class on a per-hectare basis. The optimal mitigation for each soil-climate-region was then mapped to propose geographically specific optimal GHG mitigation strategies for crops with varying N requirements. The use of empirical models reduces the requirements for valida- tion (as they are calibrated on globally or continentally observed phenomena). However, as they are relatively simple in structure, they may not be applicable for accurate site-specific prediction of GHG emissions. The value of this mod- elling approach is for initial screening and ranking of potential agricultural mitigation options and to explore the potential impact of regional agricultural GHG abatement policies. Given the clear association between management practice and crop productivity, it is essential to incorporate characterization of the yield effect on a given crop before recommending any mitigation practice.},

Earthworms incorporate organic matter into their burrow-linings thereby creating preferred habitats for microorganisms, but the roles of such burrows in priming effect initiation is unknown. Here we study the mechanisms driving SOM decomposition in top- and subsoil biopores and additionally in the rhizosphere. Given the topsoil was newly formed after ploughing 10 months prior to sampling, we hypothesized that (1) SOM accessibility, enzyme activities and efficiency of enzymatic reaction (Ka) are main drivers of different priming effect in biopores vs. bulk soil and rhizosphere, subsoil vs. topsoil and (2) the production of microbial enzymes in biopores depends on microbial community composition. To test these hypotheses, biopores formed by Lumbricus terrestris L. and bulk soil were sampled from topsoil (0–30 cm) and two subsoil depths (45–75 and 75–105 cm). Additionally, rhizosphere samples were taken from the topsoil. Total organic C (Corg), total N (TN), total P (TP) and enzyme activities involved in C-, N-, and P-cycling (cellobiohydrolase, β-glucosidase, xylanase, chitinase, leucine aminopeptidase and phosphatase) were measured. Priming effects were calculated as the difference in SOM-derived CO2from soil with or without14C-labeled glucose addition. Enzyme activities (Vmax) and the catalytic efficiency (Ka) were higher in biopores compared to bulk soil and the rhizosphere, indicating that the most active microbial community occurred at this site. Negative correlations between some enzymes and C:N ratio in bulk soil are explained by higher content of fresh organic C in the topsoil, and the corresponding C and nutrient limitations in the subsoil. The positive correlation between enzyme activities and Corg or TN in biopores, however, was associated with the decrease of C and TN with pore age in the subsoil. In the subsoil, priming effect in biopores was 2.5 times higher than bulk soil, resulting from the favorable conditions for microorganisms in biopores and the stimulation of microbial activities by earthworm mucus. We conclude that earthworm burrows provide not only the linkage between top- and subsoil for C and nutrients, but strongly increase microbial activities and accelerate SOM turnover in subsoil, contributing to nutrient mobilization for roots.},

  abstract = {Understanding microbial transformations in soils is important for predicting future carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling. This review questions some methods of assessing one key microbial process, the uptake of labile organic compounds. First, soil microbes have a starving-survival life style of dormancy, arrested activity, and low activity. Yet they are very abundant and remain poised to completely take up all substrates that become available. As a result, dilution assays with the addition of labeled substrates cannot be used. When labeled substrates are transformed into (14)CO2, the first part of the biphasic release follows metabolic rules and is not affected by the environment. As a consequence, when identical amounts of isotopically substrates are added to soils from different climate zones, the same percentage of the substrate is respired and the same half-life of the respired (14)CO2 from the labeled substrate is estimated. Second, when soils are sampled by a variety of methods from taking 10 cm diameter cores to millimeter-scale dialysis chambers, amino acids (and other organic compounds) appear to be released by the severing of fine roots and mycorrhizal networks as well as from pressing or centrifuging treatments. As a result of disturbance as well as of natural root release, concentrations of individual amino acids of \$\textbackslash sim\$10 μM are measured. This contrasts with concentrations of a few nanomolar found in aquatic systems and raises questions about possible differences in the bacterial strategy between aquatic and soil ecosystems. The small size of the hyphae (2-10 μm diameter) and of the fine roots (0.2-2 mm diameter), make it very difficult to sample any volume of soil without introducing artifacts. Third, when micromolar amounts of labeled amino acids are added to soil, some of the isotope enters plant roots. This may be an artifact of the high micromolar concentrations applied.},

  abstract = {We investigated the stability of whole profile soil organic carbon (SOC) based upon three mid-infrared predicted fractions - particulate organic carbon (POC), humus organic carbon (HOC) and resistant organic carbon (ROC) - at 100 sites across eastern Australia. Our aim was to identify the controls on SOC stability down the whole soil profile, in particular relating to climate, site and human influences. To do this we used three data-mining algorithms (randomForests, gradient boosting machines and multiplicative adaptive regression splines) to identify and assess the controls on the relative proportions of the three fractions down the soil profile. Depth was the key influence on all three fractions, with the proportion of POC decreasing, and the proportion of HOC carbon increasing with increasing depth. SOC was strongly linked with POC, suggesting that the soils in the region are input driven. HOC and ROC were controlled additionally by climate and soil physico-chemical properties (e.g. clay content, pH), with SOC being less important to these fractions. Human influences (land-use and management) were not important to the proportion of the fractions, implying that the controls humans can exert on SOC stability in these environments may be limited.},

Nocturnal summer ecosystem respiration averaged approximate to 6 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) at a mean temperature of approximate to 15 degrees C. Significant ecosystem C uptake began with the thawing of the soil in early April and was abruptly reduced by the first autumn frost in early October. Half-hourly forest CO2 exchange was regulated mostly by the incident photosynthetically active photon flux density (PPFD). In addition to the threshold effects of freezing temperatures, there were seasonal effects on the inferred photosynthetic parameters of the forest canopy. The functional response of this forest to environmental variation was similar to that of other spruce forests. In contrast to reports of carbon loss from northerly boreal forest sites, in 1996 the Howland forest was a strong carbon sink, storing about 2.1 t C ha(-1).},

The temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition is commonly determined by measuring changes in the rate of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) production under controlled laboratory conditions. We added measurements of carbon isotopes in respired CO(2) to constrain the age of carbon substrates contributing to the temperature response of decomposition for surface soils from two temperate forest sites with very different overall rates of carbon cycling. Roughly one-third of the carbon respired at any temperature was fixed from the atmosphere more than 10 y ago, and the mean age of respired carbon reflected a mixture of substrates of varying ages. Consistent with global ecosystem model predictions, the temperature sensitivity of the carbon fixed more than a decade ago was the same as the temperature sensitivity for carbon fixed less than 10 y ago. However, we also observed an overall increase in the mean age of carbon respired at higher temperatures, even correcting for potential substrate limitation effects. The combination of several age constraints from carbon isotopes showed that warming had a similar effect on respiration of decades-old and younger ({$<$}10 y) carbon but a greater effect on decomposition of substrates of intermediate (between 7 and 13 y) age. Our results highlight the vulnerability of soil carbon to warming that is years-to-decades old, which makes up a large fraction of total soil carbon in forest soils globally.},

  abstract = {Current carbon cycle-climate models predict that future soil carbon storage will be determined by the balance between CO2 fertilization and warming. However, it is uncertain whether greater carbon inputs to soils with elevated CO2 will be sequestered, particularly since warming hastens soil carbon decomposition rates, and may alter the response of soils to new plant inputs. We studied the effects of elevated CO2 and warming on microbial soil carbon decomposition processes using laboratory manipulations of carbon inputs and soil temperature. We incubated soils from the Aspen Free Air CO2 Enrichment experiment, where no accumulation of soil carbon has been observed despite a decade of increased carbon inputs to soils under elevated CO2. We added isotopically-labeled sucrose to these soils in the laboratory to mimic and trace the effects of increased carbon inputs on soil organic carbon decomposition and its temperature sensitivity. Sucrose additions caused a positive priming of soil organic carbon decomposition, demonstrated by increased respiration derived from soil carbon, increased microbial abundance, and a shift in the microbial community towards faster growing microorganisms. Similar patterns were observed for elevated CO2 soils, suggesting that the priming effect was responsible for reductions in soil carbon accumulation at the site. Laboratory warming accelerated the rate of the priming effect, but the magnitude of the priming effect was not different amongst temperatures, suggesting that the priming effect was limited by substrate availability, not soil temperature. No changes in substrate use efficiency were observed with elevated CO2 or warming. The stimulatory effects of warming on the priming effect suggest that increased belowground carbon inputs from CO2 fertilization are not likely to be stored in mineral soils. © 2014 The Authors.},

Here we demonstrate that bedrock is a nitrogen source that rivals atmospheric nitrogen inputs across major sectors of the global terrestrial environment. Evidence drawn from the planet's nitrogen balance, geochemical proxies, and our spatial weathering model reveal that \$\textbackslash sim\$19 to 31 teragrams of nitrogen are mobilized from near-surface rocks annually. About 11 to 18 teragrams of this nitrogen are chemically weathered in situ, thereby increasing the unmanaged (preindustrial) terrestrial nitrogen balance from 8 to 26\%. These findings provide a global perspective to reconcile Earth's nitrogen budget, with implications for nutrient-driven controls over the terrestrial carbon sink.}

  abstract = {Afforestation of grassland has been globally identified as being an important means for creating a sink for atmospheric carbon (C). However, the impact of afforestation on soil C is still poorly understood, due to the paucity of well designed long-term experiments and the lack of investigation into the response of different soil C fractions to afforestation. In addition, little is known about the origins of soil C and soil organic matter (SOM) stability after afforestation. In a retrospective study, we measured C mass in the soil light and heavy fractions in the first 10 years after afforestation of grassland with Eucalyptus nitens, Pinus radiata and Cupressus macrocarpa. The results suggest that C mass in the soil heavy fraction remained stable, but the C mass in the light fraction decreased at year 5 under three species. Soil δ13C analysis showed that the decrease in the light fraction may be due to reduced C inputs from grassland species litter and low inputs from the still young trees. After the initial reduction, the recovery of soil C in the light fraction depended on tree species. At year 10, an increase of 33\% in light fraction soil C was observed at the 0-30 cm depth under E. nitens, compared to that under the original grassland (year 0). Planting P. radiata restored light fraction soil C to the original level under grassland, whereas planting C. macrocarpa led to a decrease of 33\%. We concluded that the increase of light fraction soil C between year 5 and 10 is most likely due to C input from tree residues. Most of the increased C was derived from root turnover under pine and from both root and leaf turnover under E. nitens, as indicated by plant C biomarkers such as lignin-derived phenols and suberin and cutin-derived compounds in the 0-5 cm soil layer. Modelling of soil δ14C‰ suggested that SOM had a greater mean residence time at year 10 than year 0 and 5 due to increased relative abundance of recalcitrant plant biopolymers. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this theoretical framework, the percolation backbone fractal dimensionality, which generates the long-time tail of the sol- ute arrival time distribution, also predicts the scaling of the reaction rates, while laboratory proportionality to the fluid flow velocity translates to an analogous relevance of the vertical infiltration rate in the field. The predicted proportionality of solute transport to net infiltration generates simultaneously the variability in soil formation rates across 4 orders of magnitude of precipitation and 12 orders of magnitude of time scales. 1.},

Understanding the factors controlling land C uptake is critical for reducing uncertainties in projections of future climate. The relative importance of changing climate, rising atmospheric CO2, and other factors, however, remains unclear despite decades of research. Here, we use an ensemble of land models to show that models disagree on the primary driver of cumulative C uptake for 85\% of vegetated land area. Disagreement is largest in model sensitivity to rising atmospheric CO2 which shows almost twice the variability in cumulative land uptake since 1901 (1 s.d. of 212.8 PgC vs. 138.5 PgC, respectively). We find that variability in CO2 and temperature sensitivity is attributable, in part, to their compensatory effects on C uptake, whereby comparable estimates of C uptake can arise by invoking different sensitivities to key environmental conditions. Conversely, divergent estimates of C uptake can occur despite being based on the same environmental sensitivities. Together, these findings imply an important limitation to the predictability of C cycling and climate under unprecedented environmental conditions. We suggest that the carbon modeling community prioritize a probabilistic multi-model approach to generate more robust C cycle projections.},

An appreciable number of studies have been conducted to quantify the rhizosphere priming effect (RPE), and have shown that the RPE is sensitive to changes of plant and soil conditions. These diverse results across individual studies offer us an opportunity to explore for potential general patterns and variability. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis of RPE values taken from 31 publications. Our results showed that, on average, the RPE enhanced soil organic carbon mineralization rate by 59\% across all studies. The magnitudes of the RPE significantly varied among plant types and soil texture. Within plant types, woody species showed the highest RPE followed by grasses while crops had the lowest level of the RPE, indicating that plant traits and physiology may exert important controls on the RPE. Soils with finer texture tended to produce stronger RPEs than soils with coarser texture, suggesting that interactions between the rhizosphere and the soil matrix may modulate the RPE. Furthermore, the level of the RPE is positively correlated with aboveground plant biomass, but surprisingly not with root biomass which is the commonly believed key variable for influencing the RPE. In addition, the RPE increased with the length of experimental duration, which implies that the RPE may persist much longer than previously believed because it impacts stabilized soil carbon more than labile carbon as the length of experimental duration increases. Overall, the results from this meta-analysis further illustrate several complex features of the RPE and call for future attentions to decipher this complexity.},

  abstract = {Climate differences can induce profound changes in organo-mineral associations in soils. However, the magnitude of these modifications, whether as a direct effect of climate conditions or an indirect effect through changes in soil mineralogy, are still not fully understood. In this study, we aimed to improve understanding of how climate and resultant changes in soil mineralogy affect subsoil (i.e., 0.4–0.9 m) organo-mineral interactions at the macro- and microscale. A set of subsoil samples were collected throughout an elevation gradient (approximately 1800–2400 mm precipitation year−1 and 15–24 °C) on Kohala Mountain, Hawaii. We carried out a combined approach of bulk soil analyses with mineral extractions and spectroscopic and spectromicroscopic analyses. Significant positive correlations (p {$<$} 0.05) between soil organic carbon (SOC) with extracted Fe and Al (dithionite citrate bicarbonate – DCB and ammonium oxalate – OX) at the bulk soil scale supported prior research showing concurrent decline of subsoil Fe, Al and SOC above a precipitation level of ∼2000 to ∼2200 mm year−1. However, divergence in microscale organo-mineral associations identified using NanoSIMS allowed us to discern the relative roles of Fe and Al in promoting organo-mineral associations. At the lower precipitation range (∼1800 mm year−1), the clay fraction {$<$} 2 µm showed higher amounts of organic matter (OM) co-localized with Fe \& Al compared with the higher precipitation level (∼2300 mm year−1), where OM was mostly unassociated or only associated with Al. While Fe contributed to approximately 40\% of the microscale organo-mineral associations in the lower precipitation site (quantified by co-localizations with OM segments), this contribution at the higher rainfall regime was only 5\%. In contrast, the contribution of Al was approximately the same in both rainfall levels (approximately 30\%). Therefore, associations with Al may be more important than Fe for OM stabilization under reducing climate conditions. The normalized CN:C ratio based on individual pixels was found to be higher when co-localized with Al, Fe, or both, especially under the high precipitation regime. This fact points towards the importance of Fe and Al to stabilize more N-rich OM, especially at high rainfall levels. In addition, subsoil from higher rainfall conditions exhibited more reduced forms of Fe (assessed by Fe K-edge XANES) and lower proportions of carboxyl-C (5\% lower in the relative abundance) as well as higher alkyl/O-alkyl ratios determined by CP-MAS 13C NMR. Such differences in composition may directly influence the organo-mineral associations at both locations, as differences in Fe reduction and the presence of carboxyl-C groups are recognized to play a role in OM stabilization. We conclude that spatial relationships between Fe and Al with SOC at the microscale show a shift towards Al-dominated SOC associations at higher precipitation that could not be ascertained from bulk measurements alone. Therefore, they are of fundamental importance to understand the impact of climate change on SOC stabilization.},

  abstract = {Ecological stoichiometry is concerned with the ratios of different elements, particularly carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Ratios by their nature do not respond symmetrically to changes in the numerator and denominator and do not follow normal distributions; however, researchers frequently fail to consider these properties in their analyses, which has biased reported results. Calculating means, variance, or linear slopes based on untransformed ratios results in biased results. I demonstrate the consequences of these errors for inferences from stoichiometric analyses using simple examples and several large monitoring data sets. I then review 100 studies in ecological stoichiometry and find that misuse of ratio data is common, with 93\% of studies containing at least one error. These errors may be problematic, particularly in large-scale meta-analyses summarizing data over large ranges. Fortunately, most of these mistakes can be easily avoided by first log transforming elemental ratios. I therefore recommend that, to ensure robust and reproducible results, researchers in ecological stoichiometry should adopt a convention of presenting stoichiometric ratio data as the logarithm of molar ratios in the future. The widespread use of untransformed nitrogen to phosphorus ratio as an indicator of nutrient limitation has likely exaggerated the importance of phosphorus limitation, particularly in freshwater systems.},

  abstract = {Understanding and predicting ecosystem functioning (e.g., carbon and water fluxes) and the role of soils in carbon storage requires an accurate assessment of plant rooting distributions. Here, in a comprehensive literature synthesis, we analyze rooting patterns for terrestrial biomes and compare distributions for various plant functional groups. We compiled a database of 250 root studies, subdividing suitable results into 11 biomes, and fitted the depth coefficient +¦ to the data for each biome (Gale and Grigal 1987). +¦ is a simple numerical index of rooting distribution based on the asymptotic equation Y=1-+¦d, where d = depth and Y = the proportion of roots from the surface to depth d. High values of +¦ correspond to a greater proportion of roots with depth. Tundra, boreal forest, and temperate grasslands showed the shallowest rooting profiles (+¦=0.913, 0.943, and 0.943, respectively), with 80-90\% of roots in the top 30 cm of soil; deserts and temperate coniferous forests showed the deepest profiles (+¦=0.975 and 0.976, respectively) and had only 50\% of their roots in the upper 30 cm. Standing root biomass varied by over an order of magnitude across biomes, from approximately 0.2 to 5 kg m-2. Tropical evergreen forests had the highest root biomass (5 kg m-2), but other forest biomes and sclerophyllous shrublands were of similar magnitude. Root biomass for croplands, deserts, tundra and grasslands was below 1.5 kg m-2. Root/shoot (R/S) ratios were highest for tundra, grasslands, and cold deserts (ranging from 4 to 7); forest ecosystems and croplands had the lowest R/S ratios (approximately 0.1 to 0.5). Comparing data across biomes for plant functional groups, grasses had 44\% of their roots in the top 10 cm of soil. (+¦=0.952), while shrubs had only 21\% in the same depth increment (+¦=0.978). The rooting distribution of all temperate and tropical trees was +¦=0.970 with 26\% of roots in the top 10 cm and 60\% in the top 30 cm. Overall, the globally averaged root distribution for all ecosystems was +¦=0.966 (r2=0.89) with approximately 30\%, 50\%, and 75\% of roots in the top 10 cm, 20 cm, and 40 cm, respectively. We discuss the merits and possible shortcomings of our analysis in the context of root biomass and root functioning.},

  abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) anchors global terrestrial productivity and food and fiber supply. SOM retains water and soil nutrients and stores more global carbon than do plants and the atmosphere combined. SOM is also decomposed by microbes, returning CO 2 , a greenhouse gas, to the atmo-sphere. Unfortunately, soil carbon stocks have been widely lost or degraded through land use changes and unsustainable forest and agricultural practices. SOM: soil organic matter To understand its structure and function and to maintain and restore SOM, we need a better appreciation of soil organic carbon (SOC) saturation capacity and the retention of above-and belowground inputs in SOM. Our analysis suggests root inputs are approximately five times more likely than an equivalent mass of aboveground litter to be stabilized as SOM. Microbes, particularly fungi and bacteria, and soil faunal food webs strongly influence SOM decomposition at shallower depths, whereas mineral associations drive stabilization at depths greater than ∼30 cm. Global uncertainties in the amounts and locations of SOM include the extent of wetland, peatland, and permafrost systems and factors that constrain soil depths, such as shallow bedrock. In consideration of these uncertainties, global SOC stocks at depths of 2 and 3 m are estimated to be between 2,270 and 2,770 Pg, respectively, but could be as much as 700 Pg smaller. Sedimentary deposits deeper than 3 m likely contain {$>$}500 Pg of additional SOC. Soils hold the largest biogeochemically active terrestrial carbon pool on Earth and are critical for stabilizing atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. Nonetheless, global pressures on soils continue from changes in land management, including the need for increasing bioenergy and food production. to the bacteria, tumblebugs, scavengers, wordsmiths—the transfigurers, restorers —A.R.

The findings of narrative analysis indicated two main kinds of stories: as a learner and as a beginning teacher. The thematic analysis findings yield to three themes: history of learning geometry, perceptions about geometry, effective geometry instructional practices. The findings informed the quantitative investigation on geometry content knowledge for the case of quadrilaterals. During the second phase of the study, 102 participants who enrolled in the methods course completed pre and post test of teachers' geometry content knowledge. Treatment group participants (n=54) received series of activities (geometry activities and student work analysis) focusing on quadrilaterals, and control group participants (n=48) received traditional instruction. Repeated measures ANOVA results showed a significant change in treatment group participants' geometry content knowledge. The mixed ANOVA results indicated a significant main effect of knowledge but no significant interaction between geometry content knowledge and grouping. Even though treatment group participants' geometry content knowledge growth was significant, the difference between treatment group and control group participants' growth in geometry content knowledge was not significant. This study informs mathematics teacher education in three important areas; limited knowledge of preservice teachers' geometry content knowledge, integrating mathematics content and the context of teaching into methods course, and use of student work with preservice teachers.},

However, it is unclear how different forms of organic carbon (OC) compounds common in soil organic matter interact with soil minerals in the surface (A) and subsurface (B) horizons. We added four compounds (glucose, starch, cinnamic acid and stearic acid) to the silt- and clay-sized fraction (fine fraction) of A and B horizons of eight soils from varying climates (3 temperate, 3 tropical, 1 arctic and 1 sub-arctic). Equilibrium batch experiments were conducted using 0 to 100mgCL-1 of 14C-labeled compounds for 8h. Sorption parameters (maximum sorption capacity, Qmax and binding coefficient, k) calculated by fitting sorption data to the Langmuir equation showed that Qmax of A and B horizons was very similar for all compounds. Both Qmax and k values were related to sorbate properties, with Qmax being lowest for glucose (20-500mgkg-1), highest for stearic acid (20,000-200,000mgkg-1), and intermediate for both cinnamic acid (200-4000mgkg-1) and starch (400-6000mgkg-1). Simple linear regression analysis revealed that physico-chemical properties of the sorbents influenced the Qmax of cinnamic acid and stearic acid, but not glucose and starch. The sorbent properties did not show predictive ability for binding coefficient k. By using the fine fraction as sorbent, we found that the mineral fractions of A horizons are equally reactive as the B horizons irrespective of soil organic carbon content. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We compared the decomposition of native OC (native C) with that of an added substrate (glucose) on physically separated fractions of a diverse suite of soils. Five soil orders were selected from four contrasting climate zones (Mollisol from temperate, Ultisol and Oxisol from tropics, Andisol from sub-arctic, and Gelisol from arctic region). Soils from the A horizon were fractionated into particulate OC (POC) and mineral-associated OC (MOC) by a size-based method. Fractions were incubated at 20 °C and 50 \% water-holding capacity in the dark after the addition of unlabeled d-glucose (0.4 mg C g-1 fraction) and U-14C glucose (296 Bq g-1 fraction). Respiration of glucose 14C indicated 64 to 84 \% of added glucose 14C which was respired from POC and 62 to 70 \% from MOC within 150 days of incubation, with more than half of the cumulative respiration occurring within 4 days. Native C respiration varied widely across fractions: 12 to 46 \% of native C was respired from POC and 3 to 10 \% was respired from MOC fractions. This suggested that native C was more stabilized on the MOC than on the POC, but respiration from the added glucose was generally similar for MOC and POC fractions. Our study suggests a fundamental difference between the behavior of freshly added C and native C from MOC and POC fractions of soils. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

As a result pedotransfer functions (PTFs) have been developed to predict rho from other more easily available soil properties. These functions are generally derived from regression methods that aim to fit a single model. In this study, we use a technique called Generalized Boosted Regression Modelling (GBM; Ridgeway, 2006) which combines two algorithms: regression trees and boosting. We built two models and compared their predictive performance with published PTFs. All the functions were fitted based on the French forest soil dataset for the European demonstration Biosoil project. The two GBM models were Model G3 which involved the three most frequent quantitative predictors used to estimate soil bulk density (organic carbon, clay and silt), and Model G10, which included ten qualitative and quantitative input variables such as parent material or tree species. Based on the full dataset, Models G3 and G10 gave R significantly outperform the best published model. Even when fitted from an external dataset, it explained only 29\% of the variation of rho with a root mean square error of 0.244 g/cm3. In contrast, the more complex Model G10 outperformed the other models during external validation, with a R variation in forest soil bulk densities was mainly explained by five input variables: organic carbon content, tree species, the coarse fragment content, parent material and sampling depth.},

The soil organic carbon (SOC) pool is a key indicator of soil quality as it affects essential biological, chemical and physical soil functions such as nutrient cycling, pesticide and water retention, and soil structure maintenance. However, information on the SOC pool, and its temporal and spatial dynamics is unbalanced. Even in well-studied regions with a pronounced interest in environmental issues information on soil carbon (C) is inconsistent. Several activities for the compilation of global soil C data are under way. However, different approaches for soil sampling and chemical analyses make even regional comparisons highly uncertain. Often, the procedures used so far have not allowed the reliable estimation of the total SOC pool, partly because the available knowledge is focused on not clearly defined upper soil horizons and the contribution of subsoil to SOC stocks has been less considered. Even more difficult is quantifying SOC pool changes over time. SOC consists of variable amounts of labile and recalcitrant molecules of plant, and microbial and animal origin that are often operationally defined. A comprehensively active soil expert community needs to agree on protocols of soil surveying and lab procedures towards reliable SOC pool estimates. Already established long-term ecological research sites, where SOC changes are quantified and the underlying mechanisms are investigated, are potentially the backbones for regional, national, and international SOC monitoring programs.},

  abstract = {The Solling, a mountainous forested area in northwestern Germany, has been the location ofinterdisciplinary forest ecosystem research from the early 1960s on. The methodology developedand employed there was novel and pioneering at that time. It enabled the quantitative descriptionof matter and energy budgets for entire ecosystems and the connection of such process rates toecosystem structures such as species composition, age, and biotic communities. The flux monitoringmethodology developed at Solling and other early case studies is nowadays routinely applied atforest monitoring sites worldwide, e.g., in the European Level-II network of ICP Forests(International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effectson Forests). Solling holds the longest complete and continuous biogeochemical flux records inforest ecosystems worldwide.Recently the scope of forest ecosystem research at Solling has been expanded from the plotscale to the entire forest landscape. The main motivation for this scaling up was the desire totransfer the wealth of forest ecological knowledge obtained from prior research into practicalforest management. GIS-based models provide spatially explicit estimates of important indicatorssuch as diversity of forest stand types and risk of wind throw at the forest management unit level,and are a good basis to support practical forest management decisions},

  abstract = {The carbon cycle binds together earth's ecosystems and their inhabitants. My intent is to review the global carbon cycle, examine how humans have modified it, and contemplate (from a soil science bias) the new questions that await us on a changing earth. These thoughts are proffered, not to propose a way forward, but to invite conversation about opportunities that await us. Terrestrial ecosystems hold a lot of carbon - about 500 Pg C in plant biomass, and 2000 Pg C in soil organic matter. Oceans contain even more. And the atmosphere, now with about 785 Pg C, connects all of these pools. The flows of carbon between the pools, and their feedbacks, have kept atmospheric CO 2 reasonably constant for millennia. But humans have increasingly distorted the balance, by changing land use and by injecting fossil C back into the cycle. Consequently, atmospheric CO 2 has increased recently by more than 3 Pg C per year and, by century's end, its concentration may be twice pre-industrial levels, or more. The changing carbon cycle poses new questions for scientists. Now we will be asked, not how things are, but how they will be. For example: How will changes in CO 2 alter flows of carbon through biological carbon stocks? Can we manage ecosystems to hold more carbon? Are current carbon stores vulnerable should the earth warm, or water cycles shift, or nitrogen flows be altered? What will the C cycle look like a century from now; and will it then still provide all that we expect from it? These and other new questions may elicit from us fresh insights and approaches. We may learn to look more broadly at the C cycle, seeing all the 'ecosystem services' (not just C sequestration). We may insist on studies yielding deeper understanding of the C cycle, relevant beyond current issues. We may further emphasize 'time' in our studies, looking more at flows and changes than at describing what is - and looking long enough to see even subtle shifts. We may learn to follow C beyond the usual boundaries set by arbitrary disciplines. And we may come to see, more than before, how the carbon cycle weaves through our fields and skies and forests - and find new ways to reveal its grandeur to those who have not yet seen it. And then, it may happen that our successors, a century from now, will look back, almost in envy, at the urgent, enticing questions we were given to solve.

  abstract = {In this update, we review some of the more significant advances that have been made in the last decade in the study of preferential flow through the vadose zone as well as suggest some research needs in the coming years. We focus mostly on work that aims to improve understanding of the pro-cesses themselves and less on more applied aspects concerning the various consequences of preferential flow (e.g., for surface water and groundwa-ter quality). In recent years, the research emphasis has shifted somewhat toward the two extremes of the scale continuum, the pore scale and the scale of management (field, catchments, and landscapes). This trend has been facilitated by significant advances in both measurement technolo-gies (e.g., noninvasive imaging techniques and high frequency–high spatial resolution monitoring of soil moisture at field and catchment scales) and application of novel methods of analysis to large datasets (e.g., machine learning). This work has led to a better understanding of how pore network properties control preferential flow at the pore to core scales as well as some new insights into the influence of site attributes (climate, land uses, soil types) at field to landscape scales. We conclude that models do not at present fully reflect the current state of process understanding and empirical knowl-edge of preferential flow. However, we expect that significant advances in computational techniques, computer hardware, and measurement tech-nologies will lead to increasingly reliable model predictions of the impacts of preferential flow, even at the larger scales relevant for management. Preferential flow in the soil and vadose zone refers to the channeling of infiltrat-ing water and solutes through a small fraction of the pore space (Hendrickx and Flury, 2001). Preferential flow significantly affects the hydrological response to precipitation and therefore both groundwater and surface water quality at all scales of relevance for man-agement and decision making (Jarvis, 2007; Clothier et al., 2008; Beven and Germann, 2013). Preferential flow results from significant spatial variations in water velocities due to heterogeneities in soil properties at both pore and Darcy scales. Preferential flow can also occur in highly uniform soils in the form of unstable " fingers, " especially in coarse, single-grained, and water-repellent soils (DiCarlo, 2013; Wallach et al., 2013). Although the underlying causes of preferential flow may differ, one common signature is a convergence of flow toward preferential pathways and nonequilibrium in terms of differences in water pressures and solute concentrations transverse to the flow direction, which means that no single value can describe the state of the system. Under saturated conditions, preferential solute transport occurs without nonequilibrium in water pressures. However, this update focuses on the unsaturated zone, where preferential flow and transport generally occur simultaneously. We therefore use the term preferential flow throughout to imply nonequi-librium conditions for both water pressures and solute concentrations. Convergence to preferential flow paths can take place at the soil surface under near-pond-ing conditions or within the soil if the flow encounters less permeable layers (e.g., Kulli et},

Seasonal variation in both Rs and Re was better predicted by soil temperature at the 5 cm depth than at any other depth and air temperature. Re was more responsive than Rs to changes in temperature and soil water content. While nighttime (Rsn) and daytime (Rsd) soil respiration showed no difference in their response to soil temperature, daytime ecosystem respiration (Red) was less responsive than its nighttime counterpart (Ren) to changes in soil temperature. Half-hourly Red was almost always smaller than Ren possibly due to photoinhibition while daily total Red was higher than daily total Ren during summer and spring months but smaller in winter and autumn months with the latter due to fewer daylight hours. A distinct seasonal pattern in the Rs to Re ratio was observed. The 3-year mean seasonal Rs/Re was at its minimum of 0.52 in spring followed by 0.63 in summer, 0.81 in autumn and a maximum of 0.86 in winter. Both daily total and half-hourly Rsd/Red were larger than Rsn/Ren. It appears that the different responses of Rs and Re to environmental variables arise as a result of seasonal variations in photosynthesis, mobilization and use of stored carbohydrates, and differences in the phenology of aboveground and belowground plant tissues. On an annual basis, Rs accounted for 62\% of Re with the latter accounting for 86\% of the carbon (C) assimilated in annual photosynthesis or gross primary productivity (GPP), leaving the net C sequestration efficiency (1 - Re/GPP) at 14\%. In the relatively dry year of 2003, both Rs and Re as well as GPP were the lowest but with the highest net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of the 3 years. The relatively wetter growing season soil moisture regime in 2005 resulted in the highest Re and GPP. Partitioning of Rs into its autotrophic and heterotrophic components indicated that 54\% of GPP was respired back to the atmosphere as autotrophic respiration and an additional 32\% was lost in the decomposition of litterfall and soil organic matter. The mean annual estimate of net primary productivity (NPP) at 843 g C m-2 accounted for 47\% of the mean annual GPP of 1815 g C m-2. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

More sophisticated multicompartmental models are now widely used to represent turnover in soil.

  abstract = {Soil samples collected from four of the Rothamsted long-term field experiments over the last 100 yr were used to follow the effects of management on soil organic matter content. The experimental sites were:Broadbalk and Geescroft Wildernesses, both on old arable land that had been fenced off in the early 1880s and allowed to revert naturally to deciduous woodland; the unmanured plot in the Rothamsted Park Grass Continuous Hay Experiment, started in 1856; the unmanured and one of the NPK plots in the Broadbalk Continuous Wheat Experiment started in 1843. Total C, radiocarbon and (in some cases) soil microbial biomass C were measured in stored and contemporary soil samples. The current Rothamsted model for the turnover of organic C in soil was then used to calculate how the organic C content of the topsoils from the four sites would change with time for a range of annual inputs. The inputs that generated the best fit to the measured values were: Broadbalk Wilderness 3.5 t C ha-1 yr-1; Geescroft Wilderness 2.5 t C ha-1 yr-1;unmanured plot on Park Grass 3.01 t C ha-1 yr-1; unmanured plot on Broadbalk Wheat 1.3 t C ha-1 yr-1; NPK plot on Broadbalk Wheat 1.71 t C ha-1 yr-1. The model also generated the radiocarbon content of soil organic C for these inputs of C, knowing the 14C content of the atmosphere over the period 1840-1985. The marked increase in the 14C content of soil organic C brought about by thermonuclear testing during the 1960's was accurately represented by the model. The quantities of soil microbial biomass (measured by fumigation-incubation) in the top 23 cm of soil from the four sites were: Broadbalk Wilderness,1.571 t C ha-1; Geescroft Wilderness, 0.58 t C ha-1; unmanured plot on Park Grass,1.621C ha-1; unmanured plot on Broadbalk Wheat, 0.47 t C ha-1; NPK plot on Broadbalk Wheat, 0.76 t C-1.The values for soil microbial biomass C generated by the model for the above annual inputs agreed closely (with one exception) with the measured values. For a site under steady-state conditions, the annual input of organic matter to the soil plus the annual removal of organic matter from the site (if any) gives the Net Primary Production (NPP). NPP thus calculated was 4.0 t C ha-1 yr-1 for the unmanured plot on Park Grass, 2.2 for the unmanured plot on Broadbalk and 5.2 for the NPK plot on Broadbalk. The two Wilderness sites are still accumulating C in both soil and vegetation and here NPP is given by annual input to the soil, plus the annual increment of C in the trees. NPP calculated in this way was 4.8 t C ha-1 yr-1 for Broadbalk Wilderness and 3.3 for Geescroft Wilderness. This new way of estimating NPP, from measurements made on soil organic matter, needs to be tested on a wider range of soils, climates and vegetation types before it can be generally recommended. However, it has many potential advantages, not least that it can give a value for NPP that is integrated over many years from a single sampling. For sites under steady-state conditions it is not essential to have stored soil samples-the necessary measurements can be made on contemporary samples alone. © 1992.},

  abstract = {The Rothamsted long-term field experiments, started more than 150 years ago, provide unique material for the study of carbon turnover in subsoils. Total organic C, 14C and 13C were measured on soil profiles taken from these experiments, before and after the thermonuclear bomb tests of the mid-20th century. Four contrasting systems of land management were sampled: land cultivated every year for winter wheat; regenerating woodland on acid soil; regenerating woodland on calcareous soil; and old grassland. The mean radiocarbon ages of all the pre-bomb samples from cultivated land were 1210 years (0-23 cm), 2040 years (23-46 cm), 3610 years (46-69 cm) and 5520 years (69-92 cm). Bomb radiocarbon derived from thermonuclear tests was present throughout the profile in all the post-bomb samples, although below 23 cm the amounts were small and the pre- and post-bomb radiocarbon measurements were often not significantly different. Values of δ13C increased down the profile, from -26.3‰ (0-23 cm layer, mean of all measurements) to -25.2‰ for the 69-92 cm layer. The C/N ratios decreased with depth in virtually all of the profiles sampled. Excluding the surface (0-23 cm) soils from the old grassland, the hyperbola m = 152.1 - 2341/(1 + 0.264n) gave a close fit to the radiocarbon data from all depths, all sampling times and all sites, where n is the organic C content of the soil, in t ha-1, and m is the radiocarbon content of the soil, in Δ14C units, corrected for expansion or contraction of soil layers with time. The aberrant grassland soils almost certainly contained coal: one of them was shown by 13C-NMR to contain 0.82\% coal C. In Part 2 (this issue) of this pair of papers, these radiocarbon and total C measurements are used to develop and test a new model for the turnover of organic C in subsoils. © 2008 Rothamsted Research Ltd.},

  abstract = {As the largest pool of terrestrial organic carbon, soils interact strongly with atmospheric composition, climate, and land cover change. Our capacity to predict and ameliorate the consequences of global change depends in part on a better understanding of the distributions and controls of soil organic carbon (SOC) and how vegetation change may affect SOC distributions with depth. The goals of this paper are (1) to examine the association of SOC content with climate and soil texture at different soil depths; (2) to test the hypothesis that vegetation type, through patterns of allocation, is a dominant control on the vertical distribution of SOC; and (3) to estimate global SOC storage to 3 m, including an analysis of the potential effects of vegetation change on soil carbon storage. We based our analysis on {$>$}2700 soil profiles in three global databases supplemented with data for climate, vegetation, and land use. The analysis focused on mineral soil layers. Plant functional types significantly affected the vertical distribution of SOC. The percentage of SOC in the top 20 cm (relative to the first meter) averaged 33\%, 42\%, and 50\% for shrublands, grasslands, and forests, respectively. In shrublands, the amount of SOC in the second and third meters was 77\% of that in the first meter; in forests and grasslands, the totals were 56\% and 43\%, respectively. Globally, the relative distribution of SOC with depth had a slightly stronger association with vegetation than with climate, but the opposite was true for the absolute amount of SOC. Total SOC content increased with precipitation and clay content and decreased with temperature. The importance of these controls switched with depth, climate dominating in shallow layers and clay content dominating in deeper layers, possibly due to increasing percentages of slowly cycling SOC fractions at depth. To control for the effects of climate on vegetation, we grouped soils within climatic ranges and compared distributions for vegetation types within each range. The percentage of SOC in the top 20 cm relative to the first meter varied from 29\% in cold arid shrublands to 57\% in cold humid forests and, for a given climate, was always deepest in shrublands, intermediate in grasslands, and shallowest in forests (P {$<$} 0.05 in all cases). The effect of vegetation type was more important than the direct effect of precipitation in this analysis. These data suggest that shoot/root allocations combined with vertical root distributions, affect the distribution of SOC with depth. Global SOC storage in the top 3 m of soil was 2344 Pg C, or 56\% more than the 1502 Pg estimated for the first meter (which is similar to the total SOC estimates of 1500-1600 Pg made by other researchers). Global totals for the second and third meters were 491 and 351 Pg C, and the biomes with the most SOC at 1-3 m depth were tropical evergreen forests (158 Pg C) and tropical grasslands/savannas (146 Pg C). Our work suggests that plant functional types, through differences in allocation, help to control SOC distributions with depth in the soil. Our analysis also highlights the potential importance of vegetation change and SOC pools for carbon sequestration strategies.},

  abstract = {The current review investigates the hypothesis that dormant soil microorganisms are relevant for microbial processes and community changes. Dormant soil microorganisms are C limited and do not grow. However, they still have a basic metabolism, which requires organic C uptake, resulting in a slow biomass turnover. Dormant soil microorganisms respond to substrate limitation by recycling own cell components and by down-regulating enzyme-expressing genes. The adsorption of microbial cells to clay and soil organic matter, intensified by limited water availability under unsaturated conditions, reduces microbial requirements for maintenance energy but causes immobility. For this reason, soil microorganisms cannot move rapidly towards places of demand for a certain microbial ability. Consequently, it can be assumed that subsoils and deeper vadose zone sediments must have been predominantly colonized by microorganisms during periods near to the surface, with access to autotrophic C inputs. Being remote from hotspots of C input, dormant microorganisms are an important reservoir of biodiversity and potential activity if an organic substrate arrives. The turnover of the whole microbial biomass C (MBC) is the product of C use efficiency (CUE) and a maintenance coefficient. For complex osmotrophic soil microbial communities, the CUE accounts for all biomass and metabolites synthesized during growth, i.e. especially exo-enzymes but also extracellular polymeric substances. This results in a mean CUE of 0.59 for easily soluble glucose and sucrose components and a mean CUE of 0.45 for more complex organic polymers such as cellulose, straw and MBC. The annual C input limits the MBC turnover time, which varies roughly around 365 days, assuming a CUE of 0.4 for soil organic matter.},

  abstract = {Soil C and nutrient contents were estimated for eight watersheds in two sites (one high elevation, Bull, and one low elevation, Providence) in the Kings River Experimental Watersheds in the western Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. Eighty-seven quantitative pits were dug to measure soil bulk density and total rock content, while three replicate surface samples were taken nearby with a bucket auger (satellite samples) to the same depth as surface pit samples. Results showed that the higher elevation Bull watersheds had significantly greater C, N, and B contents and significantly lower extractable P, exchangeable Ca 2+, Mg 2+, and Na + contents (kgha -1) and lower pH than the lower elevation Providence watersheds. Soil NH 4 + and mineral N contents were high in both the Bull and Providence watersheds and could not be related to any measured soil property or attributed to known rates of atmospheric deposition. Nutrient analyses on satellite samples were comparable to those taken from pits when averaged on a watershed or site (Bull and Providence) scale, but quite variable on an individual grid point basis. Elevated Zn values from the quantitative pit samples suggested contamination by field sieving through a galvanized screen. Had the amount of large rocks within the soil sample not been accounted for with quantitative pit analyses, estimates of fine earth and associated C and nutrient contents (kgha -1) would have been overestimated by 16 to 43\%. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {This paper compares carbon (C) and nutrient contents in soils (Alfisols derived from andesite), forest floor and vegetation in a former fire (1960) and an adjacent forest in the Sagehen Watershed in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. Soils from the former fire (now occupied predominantly by Ceanothus velutinus, a nitrogen-fixing shrub) had significantly lower contents of extractable SO 42- and P (both Bray and bicarbonate) but significantly greater contents of exchangeable Ca 2+ than the adjacent forested site (dominated by Pinus jeffreyii). 15N data suggested that N fixation had occurred in the former fire site, but N contents did not differ between the two sites. O horizon C and nutrient contents did not differ between the two sites, but vegetation C and nutrient contents were significantly greater in the forested than former fire site. These results contrast with those from a nearby, previous study at Little Valley Nevada, also dominated by P. jeffreyii growing on a different soil type (Entisols derived from granite). In the Little Valley study, soil C, N, Ca 2+, Mg 2+, and K + contents within the former fire (1981, now also occupied predominantly by Ceanothus velutinus) were greater than in the adjacent forest (Pinus jeffreyii) but soil extractable P contents either did not differ or were greater in the former fire. We conclude that soil parent material is an indirect but strong mediator of the effects of post-fire vegetation on soils in this region, especially with respect to soil P changes, which vary substantially between andesite- and granite-derived soils. © 2012 by the authors.},

  abstract = {Understanding and accurately predicting the fate of carbon and nitrogen in the terrestrial biosphere remains a central goal in ecosystem science. Amino acids represent a key pool of C and N in soil, and their availability to plants and microorganisms has been implicated as a major driver in regulating ecosystem functioning. Because of potential differences in biological diversity and litter quality, it has been thought that soils from different latitudes and plant communities may possess intrinsically different capacities to perform key functions such as the turnover of amino acids. In this study we measured the soil solution concentration and microbial mineralization of amino acids in soils collected from 40 latitudinal points from the Arctic through to Antarctica. Our results showed that soil solution amino acid concentrations were relatively similar between sites and not strongly related to latitude. In addition, when constraints of temperature and moisture were removed, we demonstrate that soils worldwide possess a similar innate capacity to rapidly mineralize amino acids. Similarly, we show that the internal partitioning of amino acid-C into catabolic and anabolic processes is conservative in microbial communities and independent of global position. This supports the view that the conversion of high molecular weight (MW) organic matter to low MW compounds is the rate limiting step in organic matter breakdown in most ecosystems.

  abstract = {© 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland. The magnitude of the carbon flux between soil and atmosphere has prompted efforts to better understand the controls over the fate of carbon in plant litter that re-enters the atmosphere as carbon dioxide or is sequestered as soil organic carbon (SOC). It remains unresolved if the long-term fate of litter carbon is driven by biochemical properties of litter or by soil properties that reduce the ability of soil organisms to decompose litter-derived carbon. The prominent role that reactive soil minerals play in stabilising SOC have hindered investigation into the single role of litter quality on long-term SOC stability. Here we investigated the independent effects of litter quality on soil carbon stabilisation across a 460,000 year sand dune chronosequence characterised by a pronounced nutrient and litter quality gradient with minimum presence of interfering soil minerals. Using a steady state turnover model to interpret radiocarbon activity in soils collected ≈40 years apart, we show that the turnover time of SOC in the A horizon averaged 22 years (ranging from 16 t o 27 years) across the chronosequence. This finding strongly contrasts other chronosequences where SOC turnover rates range from 60 to 726 years in concert with changing abundance and composition of soil minerals. Our study demonstrates that the long-term stability of SOC in surface horizons may be largely determined by interaction with soil minerals and that litter quality per se does not govern carbon stabilisation.},

Biomass and Delta14C values were determined for fine roots collected during three consecutive winters from four sites, by depth, diameter size classes ({$<$} 0.5 or 0.5-2 mm), and live-or-dead status. Live-root pools retained significant 14C enrichment over 3 yr, demonstrating a mean turnover time on the order of years. However, elevated Delta14C values in dead-root pools within 18 months of the pulse indicated an additional component of live roots with short turnover times (months). Our results challenge assumptions of a single live fine-root pool with a unimodal and normal age distribution. Live fine roots {$<$} 0.5 mm and those near the surface, especially those in the O horizon, had more rapid turnover than 0.5-2 mm roots and deeper roots, respectively.},

We trained MTE to predict site-level gross primary productivity (GPP), terrestrial ecosystem respiration (TER), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), latent energy (LE), and sensible heat (H) based on remote sensing indices, climate and meteorological data, and information on land use. We applied the trained MTEs to generate global flux fields at a 0.5° × 0.5° spatial resolution and a monthly temporal resolution from 1982 to 2008. Cross-validation analyses revealed good performance of MTE in predicting among-site flux variability with modeling efficiencies (MEf) between 0.64 and 0.84, except for NEE (MEf = 0.32). Performance was also good for predicting seasonal patterns (MEf between 0.84 and 0.89, except for NEE (0.64)). By comparison, predictions of monthly anomalies were not as strong (MEf between 0.29 and 0.52). Improved accounting of disturbance and lagged environmental effects, along with improved characterization of errors in the training data set, would contribute most to further reducing uncertainties. Our global estimates of LE (158 ± 7 J × 1018 yr-1), H (164 ± 15 J × 1018 yr-1), and GPP (119 6 Pg C yr-1) were similar to independent estimates. Our global TER estimate (96 ± 6 Pg C yr-1) was likely underestimated by 5-10\%. Hot spot regions of interannual variability in carbon fluxes occurred in semiarid to semihumid regions and were controlled by moisture supply. Overall, GPP was more important to interannual variability in NEE than TER. Our empirically derived fluxes may be used for calibration and evaluation of land surface process models and for exploratory and diagnostic assessments of the biosphere.

  abstract = {FLUXNET comprises globally distributed eddy-covariance-based estimates of carbon fluxes between the biosphere and the atmosphere. Since eddy covariance flux towers have a relatively small footprint and are distributed unevenly across the world, upscaling the observations is necessary to obtain global-scale estimates of biosphere-atmosphere exchange. Based on cross-consistency checks with atmospheric inversions, sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) and dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), here we provide a systematic assessment of the latest upscaling efforts for gross primary production (GPP) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of the FLUXCOM initiative, where different machine learning methods, forcing data sets and sets of predictor variables were employed.{$<$}/p{$>$} Spatial patterns of mean GPP are consistent across FLUXCOM and DGVM ensembles ( at 1 spatial resolution) while the majority of DGVMs show, for 70 of the land surface, values outside the FLUXCOM range. Global mean GPP magnitudes for 2008-2010 from FLUXCOM members vary within 106 and 130 PgC class with the largest uncertainty in the tropics. Seasonal variations in independent SIF estimates agree better with FLUXCOM GPP (mean global pixel-wise) than with GPP from DGVMs (mean global pixel-wise). Seasonal variations in FLUXCOM NEE show good consistency with atmospheric inversion-based net land carbon fluxes, particularly for temperate and boreal regions. Interannual variability of global NEE in FLUXCOM is underestimated compared to inversions and DGVMs. The FLUXCOM version which also uses meteorological inputs shows a strong co-variation in interannual patterns with inversions (for 2001-2010). Mean regional NEE from FLUXCOM shows larger uptake than inversion and DGVM-based estimates, particularly in the tropics with discrepancies of up to several hundred grammes of carbon per square metre per year. These discrepancies can only partly be reconciled by carbon loss pathways that are implicit in inversions but not captured by the flux tower measurements such as carbon emissions from fires and water bodies. We hypothesize that a combination of systematic biases in the underlying eddy covariance data, in particular in tall tropical forests, and a lack of site history effects on NEE in FLUXCOM are likely responsible for the too strong tropical carbon sink estimated by FLUXCOM. Furthermore, as FLUXCOM does not account for fertilization effects, carbon flux trends are not realistic. Overall, current FLUXCOM estimates of mean annual and seasonal cycles of GPP as well as seasonal NEE variations provide useful constraints of global carbon cycling, while interannual variability patterns from FLUXCOM are valuable but require cautious interpretation. Exploring the diversity of Earth observation data and of machine learning concepts along with improved quality and quantity of flux tower measurements will facilitate further improvements of the FLUXCOM approach overall.},

The DOC retention was related to the content of dithionite-extractable iron, specific surface area (SSA, BET-N2 method) and cation exchange capacity (pH 7). The reversibility of DOC sorption was determined by a desorption experiment. All samples sorbed 20-40\% of the DOC added. The DOC sorption of the clay fractions explained the total sorption of the bulk soils. None of the mineral phase properties investigated was able to solely explain the DOC retention. A sorption of 9 to 24 μg DOC m-2 indicated that DOC interacted only with a fraction of the mineral surface, since loadings above 500 μg m-2 would be expected for a carbon monolayer. Under the experimental conditions used, the surface of the silicate clay minerals seemed to be more important for the DOC sorption than the surface of the iron oxides. The desorption experiment removed 11 to 31\% of the DOC sorbed. Most of the DOC was strongly sorbed.},

Therefore, ten soil and phyllosilicate clay fractions were used (after carbon oxidation) to investigate relationships between DOC retention at pH 7 and content of dithionite-extractable iron (Fed), specific surface area (SSA) and cation exchange capacity (CEC). DOC sorption sites were identified by blocking reactive hydroxyl groups with phosphate on subsamples. Reversibility of DOC sorption was determined by desorption experiments. Soil clay fractions sorbed about twice as much DOC as phyllosilicates. A positive relationship between DOC sorption and Fed content suggests that this is due to pedogenic oxides in soil clays. Positive trends were also observed with SSA or CEC. Sorption of 9-44 μg DOC m-2 indicates that DOC interacts only with fractions of the mineral surfaces. Phosphate treatment of subsamples reduced DOC sorption by 39-64\% indicating a contribution of reactive hydroxyl groups as well as of siloxane surfaces of phyllosilicate clay minerals to DOC sorption.

The AHS remaining in solution after sorption were studied by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, and total DOM and AHS sorbed on the surfaces of minerals by diffuse reflectance Fourier-transform infrared (DRIFT) spectroscopy. The soil samples were taken from strongly sorbing Bw horizons of two Inceptisols rich in pedogenetic Fe (29 and 35 g kg-1) and containing little C (7 and 22 g kg-1). The 13C-NMR spectra showed that sorption causes a preferential removal of aromatic and carboxyl C from the solution, whereas alkyl-C accumulates in the solution. No change was observed for O-alkyl C. The DRIFT spectra of sorbed total DOM and AHS showed a relative increase of the band intensity of carboxyl groups compared to DOM in the initial solution, confirming the importance of those groups for the sorption to mineral surfaces. The spectra also indicated reactions of carboxyl groups with metals at the mineral surfaces. The extent to which the carboxyl groups are bound depended on the surface coverage with DOM and the type of mineral.},

The untreated clay separates of the subsoils sorbed 85 to 95\% of the dissolved organic matter the whole soil sorbed. The sorption of the clay fraction increased when indigenous organic matter was oxidized by H2O2. Subsequent extraction of Al and Fe oxides/hydroxides caused a sharp decrease of the sorption of dissolved organic matter. This indicated that these oxides/hydroxides in the clay fraction were the main sorbents of dissolved organic matter of the investigated soils. Moreover, the coverage of these sorbents with organic matter reduced the amount of binding sites available for further sorption. The non-expandable layer silicates, which dominated the investigated clay fractions, exhibited a weak sorption of dissolved organic matter. Whole soils and untreated clay fractions favored the sorption of ”hydrophobic” dissolved organic matter. The removal of oxides/hydroxides reduced the sorption of the lignin-derived ”hydrophobic” dissolved organic matter onto the remaining layer silicates stronger than that of ”hydrophilic” dissolved organic matter},

  abstract = {We tested the hypothesis whether organic matter in subsoils is a large contributor to organic carbon (OC) in terrestrial ecosystems and if survival of organic matter in subsoils is the result of an association with the soil mineral matrix. We approached this by analyzing two forest soil profiles, a Haplic Podzol and a Dystric Cambisol, for the depth distribution of OC, its distribution among density and particle-size fractions, and the extractability of OC after destruction of the mineral phase by treatment with hydrofluoric acid (HF). The results were related to indicators of the soil mineralogy and the specific surface area. Finally, scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) was used to visualize the location of OC at mineral surfaces and associations with elements of mineral phases. The subsoils (B and C horizons) contained 40—50\% of the soil OC including the organic forest floor layers. With increasing depth of soil profiles (1) the radiocarbon ages increased, and (2) increasing portions of OC were either HF-soluble, or located in the density fraction d {$>$}1.6 g cm—3, or in the clay fraction. The proportions of OC in the density fraction d {$>$}1.6 g cm—3 were closely correlated to the contents of oxalate and dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate-extractable Fe (r2 = 0.93 and 0.88, P {$<$}0.001). SEM-EDX analyses suggested associations of OC with aluminum whereas silicon-enriched regions were poor in OC. The specific surface area and the microporosity of the soil mineral matrix after destruction of organic matter were less closely correlated to OC than the extractable iron fractions. This is possibly due to variable surface loadings, depending on different OC inputs with depth. Our results imply that subsoils are important for the storage of OC in terrestrial ecosystems because of intimate association of organic matter with secondary hydrous aluminum and iron phases leading to stabilization against biological degradation.},

  abstract = {The organic carbon content of soil is positively related to the specific surface area (SSA), but large amounts of organic matter in soil result in reduced SSA as determined by applying the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation to the adsorption of N-2. To elucidate some of the controlling mechanisms of this relation, we determined the SSA and the enthalpy of N-2 adsorption of separates with a density {$>$} 1.6 g cm(-3) from 196 mineral horizons of forest soils before and after removal of organic matter with NaOCl. Likewise, we investigated these characteristics before and after sorption of increasing amounts of organic matter to four mineral soil samples, oxides (amorphous Al(OH)(3) , gibbsite, ferrihydrite, goethite, haematite), and phyllosilicates (kaolinite, illite). Sorption of organic matter reduced the SSA, depending on the amount sorbed and the type of mineral. The reduction in SSA decreased at larger organic matter loadings. The SSA of the mineral soils was positively related to the content of Fe oxyhydroxides and negatively related to the content of organic C. The strong reduction in SSA at small loadings was due primarily to the decrease in the micropores to which N-2 was accessible. This suggests preferential sorption of organic matter at reactive sites in or at the mouths of micropores during the initial sorption and attachment to less reactive sites at increasing loadings. The exponential decrease of the heat of gas adsorption with the surface loading points also to a filling or clogging of micropores at early stages of organic matter accumulation. Desorption induced a small recovery of the total SSA but not of the micropore surface area. Destruction of organic matter increased the SSA of all soil samples. The SSA of the uncovered mineral matrix related strongly to the amounts of Fe oxyhydroxides and the clay. Normalized to C removed, the increase in SSA was small in topsoils and illuvial horizons of Podzols rich in C and large for the subsoils containing little C. This suggests that micropores preferentially associate with organic matter, especially at small loadings. The coverage of the surface of the soil mineral matrix as calculated from the SSA before and after destruction of organic matter was correlated only with depth, and the relation appeared to be linear. We conclude that mineralogy is the primary control of the relation between surface area and sorption of organic matter within same soil compartments (i.e. horizons). But at the scale of complete profiles, the surface accumulation and stabilization of organic matter is additionally determined by its input.},

We studied the ability to separate organic matter (OM) fractions different in stability by sequential extraction with water and sodium pyrophosphate solution. Additionally we investigated effects of crop rotation and fertilization on the content and composition of the isolated OM fractions. The control plot and three combinations of manurial treatments from a long-term field experiment were selected: mineral fertilization with P and K, mineral fertilizer with N, P and K, and cattle manure, only. SOM fractions were extracted sequentially from the soil samples using water in the first and 0.1 M sodium-pyrophosphate-solution (pH=10) in the second step. The obtained fractions were analyzed using Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. To get information on age and stability of the obtained OM fractions 14C-data were determined using accelerated mass spectrometry and the content of maize derived carbon was determined from δ13C- analysis. Based on 14C-data and the content of maize derived carbon the pyrophosphate-soluble OM fraction [OM(PY)] was found to be older than the pyrophosphate and HCL-soluble OM [OM(PY*)] and the water-soluble fraction [OM(W)]. It can be assumed therefore that the OM(PY) fraction is more stable than OM(PY*) and OM(W). Additionally, the OM(PY) fraction represents a higher proportion of total SOM and contains more carboxylic groups than the water-soluble fraction. Furthermore, this fraction shows a greater variation in the C=O content depending on the kind of fertilizer treatment than OM(W) fraction. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Stabilization of organic matter (OM) by sorption to minerals is thought to be due to (i) sorption into small pores (Ø {$<$} 50 nm) that prevents hydrolytic enzymes approaching and decomposing the organic substrate or (ii) reduced availability of organic molecules after formation of strong multiple bonds by complexation of organic ligands at mineral surfaces. We tested these two potential mechanisms by studying the binding of dissolved OM to microporous goethite (-FeOOH). The size of organic mole-cules dissolved prior to and after equilibration with goethite was determined using atomic force micro-scopy (AFM). The goethite–OM complexes were analysed for bulk and surface elemental composition (by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, XPS), specific surface area (SSA) and mesopore and micropore volumes (by N 2 adsorption/desorption), by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and by diffuse reflec-tance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy. The absolute density of goethite–OM com-plexes was determined by gas pycnometry and the sorbed OM's apparent density was calculated by assuming no major changes in the volumes of the goethite upon sorption of OM. The stability of the OM–mineral interactions was tested in desorption experiments and by treatment with NaOCl. Surface accumulation of OM by sorption decreased the N 2 -accessible SSA of the goethite, mostly because micropores (Ø {$<$} 2 nm) were rendered inaccessible to N 2 . The decrease in accessibility of micropores was most pronounced at small surface OM concentrations. The majority of dissolved organic molecules detected with AFM prior to interaction with goethite were globular with a diameter of 4–10 nm, the rest were mainly linear, 20–100 nm long and 4–8 nm thick. After contact with goethite, the latter type of molecules dominated, which suggests preferential sorption of globular molecules. Their size exceeded or equalled the size of micropores and small mesopores (Ø {$<$} 10 nm) and so sorption therein is unlikely. Also, the changes in volumes of pores with a size of 2–50 nm were smaller than the estimated volume of the OM sorbed. The apparent density of sorbed OM always exceeded that of the freeze-dried OM and was largest at small surface concentrations. DRIFT spectroscopy showed that most carboxyl groups at the goethite surface were in their complexed form. The proportion of complexed carboxyl groups dropped at larger surface concentrations, parallel to the decrease in micropore volume. Thus, micropores seem to favour the formation of multiple complex bonds per molecule. Scanning electron microscopy showed that at small surface concentrations, OM coated the goethite crystals and crystallites tightly, while at larger surface concentrations bulky accumulations of OM were more abundant. Even strongly desorbing reagents such as NaOH and Na pyrophosphate released only part of the sorbed OM. Treatment with NaOCl removed mainly bulky accumulations of OM; the OM tightly bound to goethite crystals was hardly affected by NaOCl. We conclude that molecules tightly bound via multiple complex bonds, probably at the mouths of small pores, are barely desorbable and resist the attack of chemical reagents and probably also of enzymes.},

Formation of strong bonds that reduce desorbability is one plausible explanation for that effect. With time after sorption, sorbed OM may undergo changes in configuration or may migrate into intraparticle spaces. We tested the possible effects of residence time of OM sorbed to ferrihydrite and goethite. The minerals were loaded with different amounts of water-soluble OM from an Oa horizon, then stored moist (10\% w/w water) for up to 1080 d at 4degreesC. We monitored the content of organic C, the desorbability and chemical stability (by extraction with 0.1 M NaOH-0.4 M NaF and treatment with 1 M NaOCl), and, after freeze-drying, the micro- and mesopore volume (by N2 and CO2 adsorption-desorption). Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy was used to characterize the OM on the mineral surfaces at the beginning and end of the experiment. There was no detectable decrease in sorbed organic C during the experiment; also, the micro- and mesoporosity of the samples remained unchanged. The proportion of desorbable organic C, however, decreased by up to 16\%. This was paralleled by more pronounced bands indicative of complexed organic functional groups in the DRIFT spectra. We conclude that with increasing residence time, OM sorbed to porous minerals becomes decreasingly desorbable by the formation of additional chemical bonds to the surface via ligand exchange but not by diffusion into small pores. The decrease in desorbability was accompanied by a decrease in chemical destructibility with NaOCl. The stability of sorbed OM against biological degradation may similarly increase with residence time.},

  abstract = {Studies of organic-mineral interactions in soils often include physical fractionation according to particle size and density to separate organic debris and mineral-associated matter. For density fractions, it has been noticed that Fe hydrous compounds, although having a high absolute density, can be found in fractions supposed to contain only compounds of lower density. Probable reasons are incomplete wetting due to nanopores, thus reduced apparent density, the slow settlement during centrifugation because of the small particle size, and association with organic matter, reducing the absolute density and favouring dispersion. Allocation of associations of organic matter and hydrous mineral phases to light fractions may affect the estimation of mineral-associated organic matter in soils. We tested the distribution of goethite, 2-line ferrihydrite, and amorphous Al(OH)3), associated with different amounts of organic matter, across density fractions obtained by floating in Na polytungstate solutions of 1.6, 2.0, and 2.4 g cm- 3 density, followed by centrifugation at 5000 g. Without organic matter, the two Fe minerals with absolute densities {$>$} 3.9 g cm- 3, were recovered almost completely in the fraction {$>$} 2.4 g cm- 3, irrespective the mode of dispersion (manual agitation or sonification with an energy input of 300 kJ ml- 1). Amorphous Al(OH)3, having a density of 2.2 g cm- 3, was recovered entirely in the fraction 2.0-2.4 g cm- 3 when agitated manually while little material ({$<$} 5\%) was found in the fraction 1.6-2.0 g cm- 3 after ultrasonic dispersion. Thus density fractionation properly separates pure mineral particles according to their absolute density, neither affected by small particle size nor by incomplete wetting. Organic-mineral associations, resulting either from sorptive interactions or co-precipitation, had smaller absolute densities than the pure mineral phases, according to their content of organic matter. When agitated manually, {$>$} 95\% of them were completely recovered in the appropriate density fraction, except for associations with extremely large organic contents (co-precipitates), of which small portions were found in the next lighter fraction. The application of ultrasonic energy, in contrast, resulted in up to 100\% of the organic-mineral materials to be found in lighter fractions. The portion of material recovered in lighter fractions related positively to the content of mineral-associated organic matter. The results suggest that the application of ultrasonic energy to disrupt soil aggregates can cause dispersion of negatively charged organic-mineral associations in Na polytungstate solution, resulting in erroneous allocation to density fractions. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

There is less information about the effects of land use and soil properties on the amount and composition of organic matter (OM) for subsurface soils as compared with surface soils. Here we aimed to analyse the long-term ({$>$}= 100 years) impact of arable and forest land use and soil mineral characteristics on subsurface soil organic carbon (SOC) contents, as well as on amount and composition of OM sequentially separated by Na pyrophosphate solution (OM(PY)) from subsurface soil samples. Seven soils with different mineral characteristics (Albic and Haplic Luvisol, Colluvic and Haplic Regosol, Haplic and Vertic Cambisol, Haplic Stagnosol) were selected from within Germany. Soil samples were taken from subsurface horizons of forest and adjacent arable sites continuously used for {$>$} 100 years. The OM(PY) fractions were analysed for their OC content (OC(PY)) and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Multiple regression analyses for the arable subsurface soils indicated significant positive relationships between the SOC contents and combined effects of the (i) exchangeable Ca (Ca(ex)) and oxalate-soluble Fe (Fe(ox)) and (ii) the Ca(ex) and Al(ox) contents. For these soils the increase in OC{$<$}file name="ejs\_1340\_mu1.gif" type="gif"/{$>$} (OC(PY) multiplied by the relative C=O content of OM(PY)) and increasing contents of Ca(ex) indicated that OM(PY) mainly interacts with Ca2+. For the forest subsurface soils (pH {$<$} 5), the OC(PY) contents were related to the contents of Na-pyrophosphate-soluble Fe and Al. The long-term arable and forest land use seems to result in different OM(PY)-mineral interactions in subsurface soils. On the basis of this, we hypothesize that a long-term land-use change from arable to forest may lead to a shift from mainly OM(PY)-Ca2+ to mainly OM(PY)-Fe3+ and -Al3+ interactions if the pH of subsurface soils significantly decreases to {$<$} 5.},

It is recognized that both air-drying and rewetting of soil samples affect the characteristics of organic matter (OM), but systematic evaluations are scarce. In this review, we syn- thesize what is known in the scientific literature concerning the types and magnitudes of effects resulting from air-drying and rewetting with respect to i) characteristics of aggregate-associated and water-extractable OM, ii) soil microbiota, and iii) decomposition of OM. Air-drying of soil samples results in the formation of new and/or stronger OM-mineral interactions as well as increased hydrophobicity and mineral surface acidity. The formation of new and enhancement of existing OM-mineral interactions may lead to an increase in perceived aggregate stability, potentially affecting estimates of amount and persistence of OM associated with soil aggregates. Compared to field moist samples, air-dried samples had 8e41\% higher relative dry mass proportions in the 2e0.25 mm aggregate size fraction. Pronounced changes in the amount and composition of the water-extractable OM and soil microbiota are also detected during the course of air-drying and rewetting with the potential to affect the conclusions derived from OM decomposition experiments. Air-dried soil samples were found to have 2e10 times higher amounts ofwater extractable organic carbon and a decrease between 3\% and 69\% in the microbial biomass carbon (using the substrate-induced respiration technique) compared to field moist samples. The magnitude of air-drying and rewetting derived effects on sample characteristics appears to be site and soil type specific.},

Samples were taken from the uppermost mineral topsoil horizon (0 to 5cm) of seven sites under mature deciduous forest showing OC contents between 69 and 164gkg-1and a wide range in mineral characteristics. At first, organic particles and the water-extractable OM were removed from the soil samples. Thereafter, Na-pyrophosphate extractable organic matter (OM(PY)), assumed to be indicative for OM bound via cation mediated interactions, and the OM remaining in the extraction residue (OM(ER)), supposed to be indicative for OM occluded in mechanically highly stable micro-aggregates, were sequentially separated and quantified. The composition of OM(PY) and OM(ER) was analyzed by FTIR and their stability by14C measurements. The OC remaining in the extraction residues accounted for 38 to 59\% of the bulk soil OC (SOC) suggesting a much larger relevance of OM(ER) for the OM dynamic in the analyzed soils as compared with OM(PY) that accounted for 1.6 to 7.5\% of the SOC. The FTIR analyses revealed a lower relative proportion of CO groups in OM(ER) compared to OM(PY) indicating differences in the degree of microbial processing between these fractions. Correlation analyses suggest an increase in the stability of OM(PY) with the soil pH and contents of Na-pyrophosphate soluble Fe, Al, and Mg and an increase in the stability of OM(ER) with the soil pH and the contents of clay and oxalate-soluble Fe and Al. Despite the detected influence of soil mineral characteristics on the turnover of OM(PY) and OM(ER), the δ14C signatures indicated mean residence times less than 100years. The presence of less stabilized OM in these fractions can be derived from methodological uncertainties and/or the fast cycling compartment of mineral-associated OM.},

  abstract = {Properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) determine its biodegradation. In turn, biodegradation changes the properties of the remaining DOM, which may be decisive for the formation of stable organic carbon in soil. To gain information on both mechanisms and controlling factors of DOM biodegradation and the properties of biodegraded DOM, we investigated changes in the composition of 13 different DOM samples extracted from maize straw, forest floors, peats, and agricultural soils during a 90-day incubation using UV absorbance, fluorescence emission spectroscopy, FTIR-spectroscopy, 1H-NMR spectroscopy, pyrolysis-field ionization mass spectroscopy (Py-FIMS), and 13C natural abundance before and after incubation. Changes in the DOM properties were related to the extent of biodegradation determined by the release of CO2. Increasing UV absorption and humification indices deduced from fluorescence emission spectra, and increasing portions of aromatic H indicated relative enrichment of aromatic compounds during biodegradation. This enrichment significantly correlated with the amount of DOC mineralized suggesting that aromatic compounds were relatively stable and slowly mineralized. 13C depletion during the incubation of highly degradable DOM solutions indicated an enrichment of lignin-derived aromatic compounds. Py-FI mass spectra indicated increasing contents of phenols and lignin monomers at the expense of lignin dimers and alkylaromatics during incubation. This partial degradation of higher-molecular, lignin-derived DOM compounds was accompanied by relative increases in the proportions of lower-molecular degradation products and microbial metabolites. Carbohydrates, especially when abundant at high initial contents, seem to be the preferred substrate for microorganisms. However, four independent methods suggested also some microbial production of carbohydrates and peptides during DOM degradation. After incubation, the composition of highly degradable DOM samples became similar to relatively stable DOM samples with respect to aromaticity, carbohydrate content, and thermal stability. We conclude that DOM biodegradation seems to result in organic matter properties being a precondition for the formation of stable carbon. These structural changes induced by DOM biodegradation should also result in stronger DOM sorption to the soil matrix additionally affecting DOM stabilization. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We quantified mineralized C by frequent CO2 measurements in the headspace of the incubation vessels and calculated mean residence times by a double exponential model. Mineralization of C of the corresponding DOM in solution was used as a control to estimate the extent of DOM stabilization by sorption. Changes in the composition of sorbed OM during the incubation were studied by spectroscopic (UV, fluorescence) and isotope (13C, 14C) measurements after hot-water extraction of OM. The fraction of sorbed organic C mineralized during the incubation was only one-third to one-sixth of that mineralized in solution. The mean residence time of the most stable OM sample was estimated to increase from 28 years in solution to 91 years after sorption. For highly degradable DOM samples, the portion of stable C calculated by a double exponential model nearly doubled upon sorption. With less degradable DOM the stability increased by only 20\% after sorption. Therefore, the increase in stability due to sorption is large for labile DOM high in carbohydrates and relatively small for stable DOM high in aromatic and complex molecules. Nevertheless, in terms of stability the rank order of OM types after sorption was the same as in solution. Furthermore, the extent of sorption of recalcitrant compounds was much larger than sorption of labile compounds. Thus, sorptive stabilization of this stable DOM sample was four times larger than for the labile ones. We conclude that stabilization of OM by sorption depends on the intrinsic stability of organic compounds sorbed. We propose that the main stabilization processes are selective sorption of intrinsically stable compounds and strong chemical bonds to the mineral soil and/or a physical inaccessibility of OM to microorganisms. The UV, fluorescence and 13C measurements indicated that aromatic and complex compounds, probably derived from lignin, were preferentially stabilized by sorption of DOM. The 13C and 14C data showed that degradation of the indigenous OM in the mineral soil decreased after sorption of DOM. We estimated DOM sorption stabilizes about 24 Mg C ha-1 highlighting the importance of sorption for accumulation and preservation of OM in soil. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is often considered the most labile portion of organic matter in soil and to be negligible with respect to the accumulation of soil C. In this short review, we present recent evidence that this view is invalid. The stability of DOM from forest floor horizons, peats, and topsoils against microbial degradation increases with advanced decomposition of the parent organic matter (OM). Aromatic compounds, deriving from lignin, likely are the most stable components of DOM while plant-derived carbohydrates seem easily degradable. Carbohydrates and N-rich compounds of microbial origin produced during the degradation of DOM can be relatively stable. Such components contribute much to DOM in the mineral subsoil. Sorption of DOM to soil minerals and (co-)precipitation with Al (and probably also with Fe), especially of the inherently stable aromatic moieties, result in distinct stabilization. In laboratory incubation experiments, the mean residence time of DOM from the Oa horizon of a Haplic Podzol increased from {$<$}30 y in solution to {$>$}90 y after sorption to a subsoil. We combined DOM fluxes and mineralization rate constants for DOM sorbed to minerals and a subsoil horizon, and (co-) precipitated with Al to estimate the potential contribution of DOM to total C in the mineral soil of a Haplic Podzol in Germany. The contribution of roots to DOM was not considered because of lack of data. The DOM-derived soil C ranges from 20 to 55 Mg ha(-1) in the mineral soil, which represents 19\%-50\% of the total soil C. The variation of the estimate reflects the variation in mineralization rate constants obtained for sorbed and (co-) precipitated DOM. Nevertheless, the estimates indicate that DOM contributes significantly to the accumulation of stable OM in soil. A more precise estimation of DOM-derived C in soils requires mineralization rate constants for DOM sorbed to all relevant minerals or (co-)precipitated with Fe. Additionally, we need information on the contribution of sorption to distinct minerals as well as of (co-)precipitation with Al and Fe to DOM retention.},

  abstract = {This chronosequential study focusses on the vegetation succession, pedogenesis, carbon stocks and different carbon pools of post-agrogenic Calcisol-Solonetz complexes in the dry steppe zone of Russia. The sites were comparable in terms of climate, soil texture and land-use history, but differed in the duration of agricultural abandonment, covering 1, 7, 12, 17 and 42years of self-restoration. During self-restoration without direct human impact, the vegetation developed towards a steppe with dominance of Artemisia lercheana/pauciflora and Stipa pennata. After 17years, the abundance of Artemisia pauciflora indicated again the Solonetz locations within the Calcisol-Solonetz complex, which were not visible during arable land use. Pedogenesis resulted in the recovery of the natural soil structure-fine subangular polyhedral for Calcisol and crumble fine platy for Solonetz. The recovery of soil structure of Solonetz was in accordance with a decline of water-stable aggregates from 84\% to 68\%. The plow features were still well visible after 42years of self-restoration in both soil groups. Partial integration of Btn materials into the plow layer induced a pH increase during cultivation of the Solonetzes, while slight pH decreases were observed during self-restoration afterwards. Other chemical properties of both soil groups remained unchanged. Post-agrogenic Solonetzes showed an exchange sodium percentage (ESP) below 5.0\% and an electrical conductivity (ECe) below 50mSm-1 at the topsoil during the period of self-restoration. The development towards natural soils was observed in terms of soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. SOC stocks of the Calcisols increased slowly from 2.0 to 3.5kgm-2 in the upper 0-0.5m, comprising 64\% of the natural soil. SOC stocks of the Solonetzes grew from 1.7 to 3.1kgm-2 in the upper 0-0.5m and almost reached the level of natural soil already after 12years of self-restoration. The long-term modelling showed a recovery of SOC stocks almost after 100years for the Calcisol and the Solonetz chronosequences. The nutrient dynamics traced SOC dynamics during the self-restoration. The investigation of different carbon pools showed a significant organic carbon (OC) enrichment of the density fractions {$<$}1.8gcm-3 (free particulate organic material (POM) and occluded POM) and the density fractions {$>$}1.8gcm-3 (sand coarse/medium silt, fine silt, clay) following an increase of total SOC during self-restoration. In the Calcisol chronosequence, the dynamics of all fractions was close to the dynamics of total SOC with the exception of free POM showing a moderate accumulation rate in relation to total SOC. Post-agrogenic Solonetzes showed a more intensive accumulation of free POM and a slower OC sequestration in aggregates compared to total SOC. Both chronosequences showed comparable recovery rates for the passive SOC pool and total SOC. Despite all these alterations the study showed no full restoration for many parameters within the chronosequential time scale of 42years.},

  abstract = {Strategies for mitigating soil organic carbon (SOC) losses in intensively managed agricultural systems typically draw from traditional concepts of soil organic matter formation, and thus emphasize increasing C inputs, especially from slowly decomposing crop residues, and reducing soil disturbance. However these approaches are often ineffective and do not adequately reflect current views of SOC cycling, which stress the important contributions of microbial biomass (MB) inputs to SOC. We examined microbial physiology as an alternate mechanism of SOC accumulation under organic (ORG) compared to conventional (CT) agricultural management practices, where ORG is accumulating C despite fewer total C inputs and greater soil tillage. We hypothesized that microbial communities in ORG have higher growth rates (MGR) and C use efficiencies (CUE) and that this relates to greater MB production and ultimately higher retention of new C inputs. We show that ORG had 50\% higher CUE (±8 se) and 56\% higher MGR (±22 se) relative to CT (p {$<$} 0.05). From in situ13C substrate additions, we show that higher CUE and MGR are associated with greater rates and amounts of13C glucose and phenol assimilation into MBC and mineral-associated SOC pools in ORG up to 6 mo after field substrate additions (p {$<$} 0.05). ORG soils were also enriched in proteins and lipids and had lower abundances of aromatic compounds and plant lipids (p {$<$} 0.05). These results illustrate a new mechanism for SOC accumulation under reduced C inputs and intensive soil disturbance and demonstrate that agricultural systems that facilitate the transformation of plant C into MB may be an effective, often overlooked strategy for building SOC in agricultural soils.},

Further, emerging models emphasize the stabilization of microbial-derived SOM by abiotic mechanisms, while the effects of microbial physiology on microbial residue production remain unclear. Here we provide the first direct evidence that soil microbes produce chemically diverse, stable SOM. We show that SOM accumulation is driven by distinct microbial communities more so than clay mineralogy, where microbial-derived SOM accumulation is greatest in soils with higher fungal abundances and more efficient microbial biomass production.},

We utilized thermogravimetry (TG), oven-determined mass LOI, and the Walkley-Black (WB) wet oxidation method to evaluate the relationship between OC and OM contents of carbonatic and organic soils from Florida and Puerto Rico and Spodosols from Florida. These soils have contrasting components and formed under different ecological settings. The OC content of OM, based on TG-determined OM mass LOI (TG OM) and WB OC, was higher for Histosols and Spodosols than for carbonatic soils. Regression coefficients between WB OC and TG OM were high for all soils. The factor to convert OM to OC, based on TG OM and WB OC, was 0.56 0.04 (+/- 0.04 is the 95\% confidence interval) (R-2 = 0.93) for carbonatic soils, 0.67 0.06 (R-2 = 0.94) for Spodosols, and 0.69 0.04 (R-2 = 0.99) for Histosols. Results show that accuracy in estimating OC from OM content may be improved if the conversion equation is developed from soils within limited compositional and/or biogeochemical ranges. As such, there is no universal conversion factor between OM and OC for all soils. Loss on ignition is not a reliable OM measure if there are mass losses below 200 degrees C that are mistakenly attributed to OM combustion, as in the case of reversible dehydration for Histosols of this study. However, TG enables detection of and accounting for such mass losses. Isothermal TG also confirmed that reversible mass loss between 105 and 200 degrees C was energy-rather than time dependent.},

The objective of the experiment is to quantify effects of six organic amendments and mineral N fertilizers on the crop and soil. We used the 'equivalent soil mass' concept for estimating changes in the topsoil carbon stocks in all 15 treatments. C inputs from amendments were measured and those from crops were calculated using allometric functions and crop yields. Clustering C inputs into seven categories by quality allowed us to calculate a 'humification' coefficient for each category. Here, these coefficients were simply based on the fraction of total C input that still remains in the topsoil after about 50. years. As indicated by previous studies, this coefficient was highest for peat, followed by sewage sludge, manure, sawdust and above-ground crop residues. The most interesting result from the current investigation is that the optimized coefficient for root-derived carbon was about 2.3 times higher than that for above-ground plant residues. The calculated results were found to be robust in a sensitivity analysis. Our findings strongly support the hypothesis that root-derived carbon contributes more to relatively stable soil C pools than the same amount of above-crop residue-derived C. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Despite the importance of these two processes, it is not possible to measure either at the ecosystem scale during the daytime. Eddy-covariance measurements are widely used as the closest ‘quasi-direct' ecosystem-scale observation from which to estimate ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration. Recent research, however, suggests that current estimates may be biased by up to 25\%, due to a previously unaccounted for process: the inhibition of leaf respiration in the light. Yet the extent of inhibition remains debated, and implications for estimates of ecosystem-scale respiration and photosynthesis remain unquantified. Here, we quantify an apparent inhibition of daytime ecosystem respiration across the global FLUXNET eddy-covariance network and identify a pervasive influence that varies by season and ecosystem type. We develop partitioning methods that can detect an apparent ecosystem-scale inhibition of daytime respiration and find that diurnal patterns of ecosystem respiration might be markedly different than previously thought. The results call for the re-evaluation of global terrestrial carbon cycle models and also suggest that current global estimates of photosynthesis and respiration may be biased, some on the order of magnitude of anthropogenic fossil fuel emissions.},

Recent experimental studies show that increased exudate inputs may cause a net loss of soil carbon. This stimulation of microbial carbon mineralization (‘priming') is commonly rationalized by the assumption that exudates provide a readily bioavailable supply of energy for the decomposition of native soil carbon (co-metabolism). Here we show that an alternate mechanism can cause carbon loss of equal or greater magnitude. We find that a common root exudate, oxalic acid, promotes carbon loss by liberating organic compounds from protective associations with minerals. By enhancing microbial access to previously mineral-protected compounds, this indirect mechanism accelerated carbon loss more than simply increasing the supply of energetically more favourable substrates. Our results provide insights into the coupled biotic–abiotic mechanisms underlying the ‘priming' phenomenon and challenge the assumption that mineral-associated carbon is protected from microbial cycling over millennial timescales.},

The mechanisms controlling the amount of carbon stored and its feedback to the climate system, however, remain poorly resolved. Global carbon models assume that carbon cycling in upland soils is entirely driven by aerobic respiration; the impact of anaerobic microsites prevalent even within well-drained soils is missed within this conception. Here, we show that anaerobic microsites are important regulators of soil carbon persistence, shifting microbial metabolism to less efficient anaerobic respiration, and selectively protecting otherwise bioavailable, reduced organic compounds such as lipids and waxes from decomposition. Further, shifting from anaerobic to aerobic conditions leads to a 10-fold increase in volume-specific mineralization rate, illustrating the sensitivity of anaerobically protected carbon to disturbance. The vulnerability of anaerobically protected carbon to future climate or land use change thus constitutes a yet unrecognized soil carbon-climate feedback that should be incorporated into terrestrial ecosystem models.},

Mid-elevation trees experience a montane Mediterranean climate, with near-freezing winter days and rain-free summers. The asynchrony between warmth and water input suggests low primary production, limited by photosynthetic dormancy in winter cold, and again in summer and early autumn with drought, yet this forest is characterized by tall trees and high biomass. We used eddy covariance in a mid-elevation Sierra stand to understand how winter cold and summer drought limit canopy photosynthesis and production. The trees exhibited canopy photosynthesis year-round. Trees avoided winter dormancy, and daytime CO2 uptake continued despite a deep snowpack and near-freezing temperatures. Photosynthesis on sunny days continued at half of maximum rates when air temperature was 0 °C. Likewise, the vegetation avoided summer drought dormancy, and high rates of daytime CO2 uptake and transpiration continued despite a 5-month period with only negligible water input. We attribute this drought avoidance to deep rooting and availability of deep soil water. Year-round photosynthesis helps explain the large biomass observed in the Sierra Nevada, and implies adaptive strategies that may contribute to the resiliency or vulnerability of Sierran vegetation to climate change.},

  abstract = {Soil organic matter is extensively humified; some fractions existing for more than 1000 years. The soil microbial biomass is surrounded by about 50 times its mass of soil organic matter, but can only metabolize it very slowly. Paradoxically, even if more than 90\% of the soil microbial biomass is killed, the mineralization of soil organic matter proceeds at the same rate as in an unperturbed soil. Here we show that soil organic matter mineralization is independent of microbial biomass size, community structure or specific activity. We suggest that the rate limiting step is governed by abiological processes (which we term the Regulatory Gate hypothesis), which convert non-bioavailable soil organic matter into bioavailable soil organic matter, and cannot be affected by the microbial population. This work challenges one of the long held theories in soil microbiology proposed by Winogradsky, of the existence of autochthonous and zymogenous microbial populations. This has significant implications for our understanding of carbon mineralization in soils and the role of soil micro-organisms in the global carbon cycle. Here we describe experiments designed to determine if the Regulatory Gate operates. We conclude that there is sufficient experimental evidence for it to be offered as a working hypothesis. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a method for mapping depth functions of soil organic matter (SOM) that combines general pedological knowledge with geostatistical modeling. A pedometric soil map that represents soil type at any location with a probability distribution formed the starting-point. For each of the ten soil types depicted on this map a depth function structure was defined that describes the variation of SOM over depth based on pedological knowledge about soil profile morphology. To this end five depth function building blocks were defined, referred to as 'model horizons'. For each soil type the depth function structure was obtained by stacking a subset of model horizons. The parameters of the ten soil type-specific depth functions were calibrated with data from soil profile descriptions and spatially interpolated using environmental covariates as predictors. The predicted parameters and the soil-type specific depth function structures then allowed us to construct the depth function of SOM for each soil type at each prediction site. By combining the soil type-specific depth functions with the probability distributions of the soil types, a probability distribution of depth functions was obtained at each location in the study area. The soil type-specific depth functions and their associated probabilities were used to map the SOM stock for depth intervals 0-30cm, 30-60cm, 60-90cm, and 0-90cm. The mapped SOM stocks were validated with an independent probability sample. R2-values ranged between 0.09 and 0.75, with 0.46 for the 0-90cm layer. The RSME was largest for the 30-60cm layer (13.4kg/m2). This is typically the layer with the largest within-soil type and between-soil type variation of SOM and is therefore the most challenging to predict. Similar to other studies better predictions were found for the top layer than for subsurface layers, which illustrates a general challenge of capturing subsurface variation of soil properties by our pedometric models. The pedometric approach to three-dimensional mapping of SOM presented in this paper is closely related to the conventional approach that represents depth distribution of soil properties with representative profile descriptions that are associated to the map units of a soil type map. A comparison of our pedometric approach with the conventional approach showed that there was little difference in performance. However, our modeled depth functions might give a more realistic representation of the vertical variation than the discrete (stepped) functions based on representative soil profile descriptions and thus might provide better predictions of the SOM content at small depth intervals. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Substitution of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) default methodology by country-specific activity data is recommended for improved estimation of baseline soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and their changes. In the Republic of Ireland (ROI), previous studies focused either predominantly on grassland or on all land cover types but were depth-limited. To improve the accuracy, Tier 2 approaches are proposed by the IPCC. This requires an analysis of high spatial resolution databases (such as the Irish NSDB - National Soil Database) and maps, collated for major land cover, soil types and land use areas in Ireland. In this study, data were overlaid using ArcGIS to derive information for disaggregated soil types and agricultural land use areas. Empirical models were developed using separate measurement data to estimate the NSDB-derived SOC concentrations for deeper layers, using a depth distribution function and the bulk density (ρd) using pedotransfer functions. The soil type specific models (R2=0.87-0.99) had an improved estimate of SOC densities when mineral and organic soils (peat) were treated separately. The estimated SOC densities for grasslands on mineral plus organo-mineral soils at the 0-10, 0-30, 0-50 and 0-100cm depths were 52.2, 127.1, 170.9 and 213.8t C ha-1, respectively. For arable lands, the corresponding SOC densities were 29.9, 81.3, 117.6 and 167.5t C ha-1. Nationally, for all soil types, the corresponding stocks (the products of SOC density and land cover area) were estimated to be 246.9, 608.1, 829.5 and 1079.3Tg for grassland, and 13.5, 36.7, 50.2 and 67.0Tg for arable lands in the three soil layers. The total national SOC stocks were estimated to be 888 at 0-30cm and 1832Tg at 0-100cm reference depths. For the complete soil profile, including peats {$>$}100cm depth, the national estimate was 2824Tg. The combined empirical models and Geographical Information System technique provide robust estimates of SOC stocks for disaggregated land covers and soil types, enabling Ireland to consider moving from Tier 1 to Tier 2 accounting methodology. This improved national inventory of the ROI is important for estimates of the C stock related to the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) categories. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Intensive use of N fertilizers in modern agriculture is motivated by the economic value of high grain yields and is generally perceived to sequester soil organic C by increasing the input of crop residues. This perception is at odds with a century of soil organic C data reported herein for the Morrow Plots, the world's oldest experimental site under continuous corn (Zea mays L.). After 40 to 50 yr of synthetic fertilization that exceeded grain N removal by 60 to 190\%, a net decline occurred in soil C despite increasingly massive residue C incorporation, the decline being more extensive for a corn-soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) or corn-oats (Avena sativa L.)-hay rotation than for continuous corn and of greater intensity for the profile (0-46 cm) than the surface soil. These findings implicate fertilizer N in promoting the decomposition of crop residues and soil organic matter and are consistent with data from numerous cropping experiments involving synthetic N fertilization in the USA Corn Belt and elsewhere, although not with the interpretation usually provided. There are important implications for soil C sequestration because the yield-based input of fertilizer N has commonly exceeded grain N removal for corn production on fertile soils since the 1960s. To mitigate the ongoing consequences of soil deterioration, atmospheric CO(2) enrichment, and NO(3)(-) pollution of ground and surface waters, N fertilization should be managed by site-specific assessment of soil N availability. Current fertilizer N management practices, if combined with corn stover removal for bioenergy production, exacerbate soil C loss.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Organic matter–mineral associations stabilize much of the carbon (C) stored globally in soils. Metastable short-range-order (SRO) minerals such as allophane and ferrihydrite provide one mechanism for long-term stabilization of organic matter in young soil. However, in soils with few SRO minerals and a predominance of crystalline aluminosilicate or Fe (and Al) oxyhydroxide, C turnover should be governed by chemisorption with those minerals. Here, we correlate mineral composition from soils containing small amounts of SRO minerals with mean turnover time (TT) of C estimated from radiocarbon (\textsuperscript{14}C) in bulk soil, free light fraction and mineral-associated organic matter. We varied the mineral amount and composition by sampling ancient soils formed on different lithologies in arid to subhumid climates in Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa. Mineral contents in bulk soils were assessed using chemical extractions to quantify Fe oxyhydroxides and SRO minerals. Because of our interest in the role of silicate clay mineralogy, particularly smectite (2:1) and kaolinite (1:1), we separately quantified the mineralogy of the clay-sized fraction using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and measured \textsuperscript{14}C on the same fraction. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} Density separation demonstrated that mineral associated C accounted for 40–70\% of bulk soil organic C in A and B1 horizons for granite, nephelinite and arid-zone gabbro soils, and \&gt;80\% in other soils. Organic matter strongly associated with the isolated clay-sized fraction represented only 9–47\% of the bulk soil C. The mean TT of C strongly associated with the clay-sized fraction increased with the amount of smectite (2:1 clays); in samples with \&gt;40\% smectite it averaged 1020±460 years. The C not strongly associated with clay-sized minerals, including a combination of low-density C, the C associated with minerals of sizes between 2µm and 2cm (including Fe oxyhydroxides as coatings), and C removed from clay-sized material by 2\% hydrogen peroxide had TTs averaging 190±190 years in surface horizons. Summed over the bulk soil profile, we found that smectite content correlated with the mean TT of bulk soil C across varied lithologies. The SRO mineral content in KNP soils was generally very low, except for the soils developed on gabbros under more humid climate that also had very high Fe and C contents with a surprisingly short, mean C TTs. In younger landscapes, SRO minerals are metastable and sequester C for long timescales. We hypothesize that in the KNP, SRO minerals represent a transient stage of mineral evolution and therefore lock up C for a shorter time. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} Overall, we found crystalline Fe-oxyhydroxides (determined as the difference between Fe in dithionate citrate and oxalate extractions) to be the strongest predictor for soil C content, while the mean TT of soil C was best predicted from the amount of smectite, which was also related to more easily measured bulk properties such as cation exchange capacity or pH. Combined with previous research on C turnover times in 2:1 vs. 1:1 clays, our results hold promise for predicting C inventory and persistence based on intrinsic timescales of specific carbon–mineral interactions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Exploring the effects of those achievements on the social problem solving of students is also of interest. For this purpose, the MMORPG Gersang was used. The participants, consisting of ninth graders, played the game until they all reached the third level to ensure that they have the same gaming ability prior to gaming for the study. Three meta-cognitive strategies were developed: self-recording, modeling and thinking aloud. Those strategies are specially related to gaming activities and applied in pre-gaming activities, gaming activities, and post-gaming activities. Three meta-cognitive strategies were set as independent variables. The social problem solving ability was set as a mediating variable, and academic achievement and scores in the game were chosen as dependent variables. The path between meta-cognitive strategies and both academic achievement and game performance by mediating social problem solving abilities were discovered. The social problem solving ability, which is the mediating variable, affects the academic achievement and the game performance very strongly. These results imply that a commercial game playing in conjunction with meta-cognitive strategies can be an effective way to increase students' performance both in learning and gaming by keeping them involved. Talking and observation activities such as thinking aloud and modeling are more effective than writing activities in enhancing the students' achievements both in learning and gaming.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The rewetting of dry soils and the thawing of frozen soils are short-term, transitional phenomena in terms of hydrology and the thermodynamics of soil systems. The impact of these short-term phenomena on larger scale ecosystem fluxes is increasingly recognized, and a growing number of studies show that these events affect fluxes of soil gases such as carbon dioxide (CO\textsubscript{2}), methane (CH\textsubscript{4}), nitrous oxide (N\textsubscript{2}O), ammonia (NH\textsubscript{3}) and nitric oxide (NO). Global climate models predict that future climatic change is likely to alter the frequency and intensity of drying-rewetting events and thawing of frozen soils. These future scenarios highlight the importance of understanding how rewetting and thawing will influence dynamics of these soil gases. This study summarizes findings using a new database containing 338 studies conducted from 1956 to 2011, and highlights open research questions. The database revealed conflicting results following rewetting and thawing in various terrestrial ecosystems and among soil gases, ranging from large increases in fluxes to non-significant changes. Studies reporting lower gas fluxes before rewetting tended to find higher post-rewetting fluxes for CO\textsubscript{2}, N\textsubscript{2}O and NO; in addition, increases in N\textsubscript{2}O flux following thawing were greater in warmer climate regions. We discuss possible mechanisms and controls that regulate flux responses, and recommend that a high temporal resolution of flux measurements is critical to capture rapid changes in gas fluxes after these soil perturbations. Finally, we propose that future studies should investigate the interactions between biological (i.e., microbial community and gas production) and physical (i.e., porosity, diffusivity, dissolution) changes in soil gas fluxes, apply techniques to capture rapid changes (i.e., automated measurements), and explore synergistic experimental and modelling approaches.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

A nearly four-year field experiment was conducted on a small agricultural watershed near Coshocton, OH, USA, to assess the applicability of the REE technique for a multi-year period and to evaluate the relative contributions of sediment sources in the watershed. Tracer depletion and tracer enrichment ratio (ratio of the tracer concentrations in sediment to the concentrations in the soil in the areas of application) were evaluated to examine the applica- bility and accuracy of the technique. A minimum of 91 per cent of the mass of the applied elements was still available on any individual morphological element at the end of the ex- perimental period. The tracer enrichment ratio varied from 0·4 to 2·3, and it was not signifi- cantly related to time. The relative contributions of six morphological elements within the watershed were evaluated as proportions to total sediment yield. The relative contribution of the lower channel was significantly increased as a function of the amount of sediment yield, while that of the lower backslope was significantly decreased. The relative contribution of the lower channel significantly decreased as a function of cumulative sediment yield, while the contributions of the shoulder and the upper backslope significantly increased. Our results showed that the REE technique can be used to track sediment sources for a relatively long period with two limitations or potential sources of error associated with a selective depletion of tracers and a contamination of downslope areas with tagged sediments from upslope areas.

The C:N:P:S ratios were investigated for a series of soils to test the hypothesis that the stable portion of the soil organic material (humus) has constant ratios of C:N:P:S. Constant ratios, if established, would provide an excellent tool to evaluate the feasibility, cost and strategies to sequester soil C in terrestrial ecosystems. Freshly-collected Australian soils cited in the literature were analysed for total C, N, P, organic P (OP) and S, and the ratios were compared with values for soils from numerous locations around the world, hereafter known as the International soils. Total N and S were highly correlated with C for the International and Australian soils and the relationships were similar for both sets. The correlation of C with P for Australian soils was not as strong as the correlations with N and S, however, a stronger relationship was found for OP than P with C. The correlation of OP with C for the International soils was not as strong as for the Australian soils probably due, in part, to the different methodologies used to analyse soil for OP in the International soils compared with the single method used for the Australian soils. The weaker relationship between OP and C for both sets of soils, compared with the relationship between N, S and C was probably also due, in part, to the wide variety of compounds in the soil OP pool which vary in their relationship with humus and the wide C:P ratio found in the soil microbial biomass. Overall, the C:N:OP:S ratios were constant for the stable portion of the soil organic material and these were consistent across a wide range of global soils and should provide a reliable basis with which to determine the level to which the availability of N, P and S may limit humus-C sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems although further research is needed to more accurately determine the amount of OP in humus. ?? 2011.},

  abstract = {Soils are the largest reservoir of global terrestrial carbon (C). Conversion from natural to agricultural ecosystems has generally resulted in a significant loss of soil organic-C (SOC, up to 50\% or \$\textbackslash sim\$30-40tha-1) and 'restoring' this lost C is a significant global challenge. The most stable component of soil organic matter (SOM), hereafter referred to as fine fraction SOM (FF-SOM), contains not only C, hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O), but substantial amounts of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and sulphur (S), in approximately constant ratios. The availability of these associated nutrients is essential for the formation of FF-SOM. Here we show, in short term (56 day) incubation experiments with 13C labelled wheaten straw added to four soils with differing clay content, that conversion of straw into "new" FF-SOM is increased by up to three-fold by augmenting the residues with supplementary nutrients. We also show that the loss of "old" pre-existing FF-SOM increased with straw addition, compared to soils with no straw addition, but that this loss was ameliorated by nutrient addition in two of our soils. This finding may illuminate why the build-up of SOC in some productive agricultural soils is often much less than expected from the amounts of C-rich residues returned to them because optimum C sequestration requires additional nutrients above that required for crop production alone. Moreover, it provides greater understanding of short-term dynamics of C turnover in soil, and in the longer term, may have important implications for global strategies aimed at increasing soil C sequestration to restore fertility and help mitigate climate change. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Clay minerals and pedogenic metal (oxyhydr)oxides are the most reactive soil mineral constituents controlling the long-term persistence of organic carbon (OC) in terrestrial ecosystems. However, their co-occurrence in most soils complicates direct assessment of their individual contribution to OC persistence. Making use of unique mineralogical combinations in soils located in the East Usambara Mountains of Tanzania, we disentangled the contribution of clay-sized aluminous minerals (kaolinite, gibbsite) and pedogenic Fe (oxyhydr)oxides (predominant goethite and hematite) on OC storage and stabilization under natural forests and croplands. Topsoil samples, varying in contents but not types of aluminous clays and pedogenic Fe (oxyhydr)oxides, were identified by selective extractions, X-ray diffraction, and Mössbauer spectroscopy. Associated abundance of particulate and mineral-associated organic matter (OM) was quantified by density fractionation and their changes during land-use conversion were determined as a measure of OC persistence. Additionally, we assessed the resistance of OC to chemical oxidation as well as microbial decomposition in a 50-day laboratory incubation. We found that the ratio of pedogenic Fe to aluminous clay is more consequential for OC storage and stabilization than their individual contents, despite the fact that Fe (oxyhydr)oxides generally exert a stronger impact on OC than aluminous clays. Conjunction of large amounts of Fe (oxyhydr)oxides with low aluminous clay contents caused the strongest accumulation of mineral-associated OC, a low soil respiration, high OC stability against chemical oxidation, and high OC persistence during land-use change. Our study suggests that certain mineralogical combinations in the humid tropics alleviate OM losses during land conversion because of the strong and selective mineral control on OC stabilization, particular if the weight ratio of pedogenic Fe to aluminous clay exceeds the threshold range of 0.44‒0.56.},

  abstract = {Soil minerals are known to influence the biological stability of soil organic matter (SOM). Our study aimed to relate properties of the mineral matrix to its ability to protect organic C against decomposition in acid soils. We used the amount of hydroxyl ions released after exposure to NaF solution to establish a reactivity gradient spanning 12 subsoil horizons collected from 10 different locations. The subsoil horizons represent six soil orders and diverse geological parent materials. Phyllosilicates were character- ized by X-ray diffraction and pedogenic oxides by selective dissolution procedures. The organic carbon (C) remaining after chemical removal of an oxidizable fraction of SOM with NaOCl solution was taken to represent a stable organic carbon pool. Stable organic carbon was confirmed as older than bulk organic carbon by a smaller radiocarbon (14C) content after oxidation in all 12 soils. The amount of stable organic C did not depend on clay content or the content of dithionite–citrate-extractable Fe. The combination of oxalate-extractable Fe and Al explained the greatest amount of variation in stable organic C (R2¼0.78). Our results suggest that in acid soils, organic matter is preferentially protected by interaction with poorly crystalline minerals represented by the oxalate-soluble Fe and Al fraction. This evidence suggests that ligand exchange between mineral surface hydroxyl groups and negatively charged organic functional groups is a quantitatively important mechanism in the stabilization of SOM in acid soils. The results imply a finite stabilization capacity of soil minerals for organic matter, limited by the area density of reactive surface sites. Introduction Minerals exert control over soil organic matter (SOM) content through mechanisms that protect either organic inputs or their decomposition products against biological attack. Models of SOM turnover, while incorporating soil texture (i.e. clay con- tent) as a key element in carbon (C) dynamics, generally treat the impact of clay on C stabilization as being independent of clay mineralogy (Paustian et al., 1997). However, more than five decades ago Allison et al. (1949) showed that the amount of organic C surviving in a decomposition experiment depended on the type of clay mineral present. Recent research also indicates a differential capacity of minerals to adsorb and protect organic matter as a result of mineral-specific properties such as surface area, charge characteristics and porosity (Krull et al., 2003). Schnitzer \& Kodama (1992) emphasized the importance of poorly crystalline minerals for C retention and turnover in Correspondence: M. Kleber.

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a structure for organo-mineral associations in soils based on recent insights concerning the molecular structure of soil organic matter (SOM), and on extensive published evidence from empirical studies of organo-mineral interfaces. Our conceptual model assumes that SOM consists of a heterogeneous mixture of compounds that display a range of amphiphilic or surfactant-like properties, and are capable of self-organization in aqueous solution. An extension of this self-organizational behavior in solution, we suggest that SOM sorbs to mineral surfaces in a discrete zonal sequence. In the contact zone, the formation of particularly strong organo-mineral associations appears to be favored by situations where either (i) polar organic functional groups of amphiphiles interact via ligand exchange with singly coordinated mineral hydroxyls, forming stable inner-sphere complexes, or (ii) proteinaceous materials unfold upon adsorption, thus increasing adhesive strength by adding hydrophobic interactions to electrostatic binding. Entropic considerations dictate that exposed hydrophobic portions of amphiphilic molecules adsorbed directly to mineral surfaces be shielded from the polar aqueous phase through association with hydrophobic moieties of other amphiphilic molecules. This process can create a membrane-like bilayer containing a hydrophobic zone, whose components may exchange more easily with the surrounding soil solution than those in the contact zone, but which are still retained with considerable force. Sorbed to the hydrophilic exterior of hemimicellar coatings, or to adsorbed proteins, are organic molecules forming an outer region, or kinetic zone, that is loosely retained by cation bridging, hydrogen bonding, and other interactions. Organic material in the kinetic zone may experience high exchange rates with the surrounding soil solution, leading to short residence times for individual molecular fragments. The thickness of this outer region would depend more on input than on the availability of binding sites, and would largely be controlled by exchange kinetics. Movement of organics into and out of this outer region can thus be viewed as similar to a phase-partitioning process. The zonal concept of organo-mineral interactions presented here offers a new basis for understanding and predicting the retention of organic compounds, including contaminants, in soils and sediments. ? 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

  abstract = {Soil carbon turnover models generally divide soil carbon into pools with varying intrinsic decomposition rates. Although these decomposition rates are modified by factors such as temperature, texture, and moisture, they are rationalized by assuming chemical structure is a primary controller of decomposition. In the current work, we use near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy in combination with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and alkaline cupric oxide (CuO) oxidation to explore this assumption. Specifically, we examined material from the 2.3-2.6kgL-1 density fraction of three soils of different type (Oxisol, Alfisol, Inceptisol). The density fraction with the youngest 14C age (Oxisol, 107 years) showed the highest relative abundance of aromatic groups and the lowest O-alkyl C/aromatic C ratio as determined by NEXAFS. Conversely, the fraction with the oldest C (Inceptisol, 680 years) had the lowest relative abundance of aromatic groups and highest O-alkyl C/aromatic C ratio. This sample also had the highest proportion of thermally labile materials as measured by DSC, and the highest ratio of substituted fatty acids to lignin phenols as indicated by CuO oxidation. Therefore, the organic matter of the Inceptisol sample, with a 14C age associated with 'passive' pools of carbon (680 years), had the largest proportion of easily metabolizable organic molecules with low thermodynamic stability, whereas the organic matter of the much younger Oxisol sample (107 years) had the highest proportion of supposedly stable organic structures considered more difficult to metabolize. Our results demonstrate that C age is not necessarily related to molecular structure or thermodynamic stability, and we suggest that soil carbon models would benefit from viewing turnover rate as codetermined by the interaction between substrates, microbial actors, and abiotic driving variables. Furthermore, assuming that old carbon is composed of complex or 'recalcitrant' compounds will erroneously attribute a greater temperature sensitivity to those materials than they may actually possess. ? 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

In soils, the associations of OM with mineral surfaces are mainly investigated because of their role in determining the long-term retention of OM. OM "must decay in order to release the energy and nutrients that drive live processes all over the planet" (Janzen, 2006). Thus, the processes and mechanisms that retain OM in soil are a central concern to very different branches of environmental research. An agronomist may want to synchronize periods of high nutrient and energy release with the growth stages of a crop. An environmental chemist may wish to either immobilize an organic soil contaminant or enhance its decomposition into less harmful metabolites, while climate scientists need to understand the processes that mediate the production of potent greenhouse gases from decomposing OM. Associations of OM with pedogenic minerals (henceforth termed mineral-organic associations (MOAs)) are known to be key controls in these and many other processes.

  abstract = {Understanding the effects of varying average annual precipitation on organic carbon in loess-derived soils can assist the reconstruction of paleoclimates from buried paleosol sequences as well as facilitate the prediction of soil organic carbon (SOC) change in response to future climate forcings. The goal of this study was to examine trends in SOC and its relationships to particle-size distribution (PSD) and soil aggregation in surface loess along a precipitation gradient in the Central Great Plains of the United States. Soil cores were collected from undisturbed portions of seven pioneer cemeteries to a depth of 50cm across a transect spanning northwest Kansas into western Missouri. Pioneer cemeteries were selected to minimize any effect from land use and disturbance. Soil cores were cut into 2.5-cm segments, which were prepared and analyzed for bulk density, SOC, and aggregated and disaggregated PSD from laser diffraction. Annual precipitation, depth, and PSD were used in the multivariate analyses to explain the distribution of SOC and complexed organic carbon (COC)-an indicator of soil physical quality-as well as bulk density. Precipitation was the variable that most explained SOC, COC, and bulk density. A proxy for microaggregation, geometric mean shift (GMS), was developed for this study and defined as the difference between the geometric mean of the aggregated and disaggregated PSDs. Microaggregation occurred below an OC:clay ratio of 0.163 in the upper 50cm of the loess-derived soils analyzed. Among the variables considered, COC had the highest coefficient of determination (R\textsuperscript{2}=0.871). Our findings indicate that future climate forcings resulting in precipitation changes may have an effect on COC and, thus, soil physical quality of loess-derived soils.},

  abstract = {Subsurface horizons contain more than half of the global soil carbon (C), yet the dynamics of this C remains poorly understood. We estimated the amount of decadally cycling subsurface C (∼20 to 60 cm depth) from the incorporation of ‘bomb' radiocarbon (14C) using samples taken over 50 years from grassland and forest soils in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California. The radiocarbon content of all organic matter fractions (roots, low-density (LF), high-density (HF), and non-oxidizable HF) increased from the pre- to post-bomb samples, indicating ∼1–6 kgC m−2, or about half of the subsoil C, consists of C fixed since 1963. Low-density (LF-C) represented {$<$}24\% (grassland) to 40–55\% (forest) of the subsurface C and represented a mixture of post-bomb C and varying amounts of pre-1950 charcoal, identified using 13C-NMR spectroscopy. The 14C content of HF-C increased rapidly from 1992 to 2009, indicating a significant time lag ({$>$}20 years) for the arrival of ‘bomb' 14C to this fraction. A two-pool (fast-cycling and passive) model including {$>$}20 year time lag showed that 28–73\% of the subsoil mineral-associated C had turnover times of 10–95 years. Microbially respired C was enriched in bomb 14C compared to both LF and HF fractions in 2009. Overall, we estimate that C fluxes through decadally cycling pools in the subsurface are equivalent to 1–9\% (grassland) to 10–54\% (forest) of the surface litterfall at these sites. Our results demonstrate the importance of decadally cycling C for ecosystem C balance, and that a lagged response of the large subsurface C stores to changes in environmental conditions is possible.},

We studied the response of soil carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux to long-term experimental N addition (125 kg N ha-1 yr-1) in mature lowland and montane forests in Panama. In the lowland forest, on soils with high nutrient-supplying and buffering capacity, fine litterfall and stem-growth were neither N- nor phosphorus-limited. In the montane forest, on soils with low nutrient supplying capacity and an organic layer, fine litterfall and stem-growth were N-limited. Our objectives were to 1) explore the influence of soil temperature and moisture on the dynamics of soil CO2 efflux and 2) determine the responses of soil CO2 efflux from an N-rich and N-limited forest to elevated N input. Annual soil CO2-C efflux was larger in the lowland (15.44 ± 1.02 Mg C ha-1) than in the montane forest (9.37 ± 0.28 Mg C ha-1). In the lowland forest, soil moisture explained the largest fraction of the variance in soil CO 2 efflux while soil temperature was the main explanatory variable in the montane forest. Soil CO2 efflux in the lowland forest did not differ between the control and 9-11 yr N-addition plots, suggesting that chronic N input to nutrient-rich tropical lowland forests on well-buffered soils may not change their C balance on a decadal time scale. In the montane forest, first year N addition did not affect soil CO2 efflux but annual CO 2 efflux was reduced by 14\% and 8\% in the 2nd and 3rd year N-addition plots, respectively, compared to the control. This reduction was caused by a decrease in soil CO2 efflux during the high stem-growth period of the year, suggesting a shift in carbon partitioning from below- to aboveground in the N-addition plots in which stem diameter growth was promoted.},

We investigated how a decade of experimental N addition (125 kg N ha-1 year-1) to a seasonal lowland forest affected depth distribution and contents of soil nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), as well as natural abundance isotopic signatures of N2O, nitrate (NO3 -) and ammonium (NH4 +). In the control plots during dry season, we deduced limited N2O production by denitrification in the topsoil (0. 05-0. 40 m) as indicated by: ambient N2O concentrations and ambient 15N-N2O signatures, low water-filled pore space (35-60\%), and similar 15N signatures of N2O and NO3 -. In the subsoil (0. 40-2. 00 m), we detected evidence of N2O reduction to N2 during upward diffusion, indicating denitrification activity. During wet season, we found that N2O at 0. 05-2. 00 m was mainly produced by denitrification with substantial further reduction to N2, as indicated by: lighter 15N-N2O than 15N-NO3 - throughout the profile, and increasing N2O concentrations with simultaneously decreasing 15N-N2O enrichment with depth. These interpretations were supported by an isotopomer map and by a positive correlation between 18O-N2O and 15N-N2O site preferences. Long-term N addition did not affect dry-season soil N2O-N contents, doubled wet-season soil N2O-N contents, did not affect 15N signatures of NO3 -, and reduced wet-season 15N signatures of N2O compared to the control plots. These suggest that the increased NO3 - concentrations have stimulated N2O production and decreased N2O-to-N2 reduction. Soil CO2-C contents did not differ between treatments, implying that N addition essentially did not influence soil C cycling. The pronounced seasonality in soil respiration was largely attributable to enhanced topsoil respiration as indicated by a wet-season increase in the topsoil CO2-C contents. The N-addition plots showed reduced dry-season soil CH4-C contents and threshold CH4 concentrations were reached at a shallower depth compared to the control plots, revealing an N-induced stimulation of methanotrophic activity. However, the net soil CH4 uptake rates remained similar between treatments possibly because diffusive CH4 supply from the atmosphere largely limited CH4 oxidation. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

However, few studies have combined those microorganisms in one experiment to clarify their relative contribution and interactions in nutrient acquisition. Here, we monitored the respective contributions of pine roots, two ubiquitous forest ectomycorrhizal fungi Scleroderma citrinum and Laccaria bicolor, and two S. citrinum-mycorrhizosphere bacterial strains of Burkholderia glathei and Collimonas sp., on mineral weathering, nutrient uptake, and plant growth. Pinus sylvestris plants were grown on quartz-biotite substrate and inoculated or not with combinations of mycorrhizal fungi and/or bacterial strains. Magnesium and potassium fluxes were measured and nutrient budgets were calculated. Both ectomycorrhizal fungi significantly increased Mg plant uptake. No significant effects of the two bacterial strains were detected on the K and Mg budgets, but co-inoculating the mycorrhizal fungus S. citrinum and the efficient mineral-weathering B. glathei bacterial strain significantly improved the Mg budget. Similarly, co-inoculating S. citrinum with the Collimonas sp. bacterial strain significantly improved the pine biomass compared to non-inoculated pine plants. In order to better understand this process, we monitored the survival of the inoculated bacterial strains in the quartz-biotite substrate, the pine rhizosphere, and the mycorrhizal niche. The results showed that the two bacterial strains harboured different colonization behaviours both of which depended on the presence of the ectomycorrhizal partner. The populations of the Burkholderia strain were maintained in all these environments with a significantly higher density in the mycorrhizal niche, especially of S. citrinum. In contrast the population of the Collimonas strain reached the detection level except in the treatment inoculated with S. citrinum. These results highlight the need for taking into account the ecology of the microorganisms, and more specifically the fungal-bacterial interactions, when studying mineral weathering and plant nutrition. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Similarly, (recalcitrant) organic matter (OM) is an important nutrient source largely made plant‐available through (symbiotic) microorganisms, especially in the topsoil. We hypothesized that in a podzol profile, fungal hyphae would concentrate in nutrient hotspots, either OM or the coarse‐soil fraction. Absolute hyphal length, base saturation, and organic‐C content of a Podzol profile were determined in the fine‐earth and coarse‐soil fractions. In the fine‐earth fraction, hyphae were attracted by the organic‐C content and relative high base saturation. In the coarse‐soil fraction of the BhBs horizon, the absolute hyphal length exceeded the hyphal length in the fine earth by factor 3, yet C content and base saturation were lowest. We could not determine to what fungi the hyphae belonged. Most likely ectomycorrhiza, ericoid mycorrhiza and saprotrophic fungi dominate the upper soil layers of this profile and all utilize OM for nutrition. In the deeper mineral horizons and especially in the coarse‐soil fraction, ectomycorrhiza are better adapted than other fungi to harvest nutrients from inorganic sources. Additionally, favorable physical properties may explain the high amount of fungal hyphae in the coarse‐soil fraction of the BhBs horizon. Both the coarse‐soil fraction and deeper mineral soil horizons may play a more active role in microbial nutrient cycling than previously assumed.},

  abstract = {We summarize progress with respect to (1) different approaches to isolate, extract, and quantify organo-mineral compounds fromsoils, (2) types of mineral surfaces and associated interactions, (3) the distribution and function of soil biota at organo-mineral surfaces, (4) the distribution and content of organo-mineral associations, and (5) the factors controlling the turnover of organic matter (OM) in organo-mineral associations from temperate soils. Physical fractionation achieves a rough separation between plant residues and mineral-associated OM, which makes density or particle-size fractionation a useful pretreatment for further differentiation of functional fractions. A part of the OM in organo-mineral associations resists different chemical treatments, but the data obtained cannot readily be compared among each other, and more research is necessary on the processes underlying resistance to treatments for certain OM components. Studies using physical-fractionation procedures followed by soil-microbiological analyses revealed that organo-mineral associations spatially isolate C sources from soil biota, making quantity and quality of OM in microhabitats an important factor controlling community composition. The distribution and activity of soil microorganisms at organo-mineral surfaces can additionally be modified by faunal activities. Composition of OM in organo-mineral associations is highly variable, with loamy soils having generally a higher contribution of polysaccharides, whereas mineral-associated OM in sandy soils is often more aliphatic. Though highly reactive towards Fe oxide surfaces, lignin and phenolic components are usually depleted in organo-mineral associations. Charred OM associated with the mineral surface contributes to a higher aromaticity in heavy fractions. The relative proportion of OC bound in organomineral fractions increases with soil depth. Likewise does the strength of the bonding. Organic molecules sorbed to the mineral surfaces or precipitated by Al are effectively stabilized, indicated by reduced susceptibility towards oxidative attack, higher thermal stability, and lower bioavailability. At higher surface loading, organic C is much better bioavailable, also indicated by little 14C age. In the subsurface horizons of the soils investigated in this study, Fe oxides seem to be the most important sorbents, whereas phyllosilicate surfaces may be comparatively more important in topsoils. Specific surface area of soilminerals is not always a good predictor for C-stabilization potentials because surface coverage is discontinuous. Recalcitrance and accessibility/aggregation seem to determine the turnover dynamics in fast and intermediate cycling OM pools, but for long-term OC preservation the interactions with mineral surfaces, and especially with Fe oxide surfaces, are a major control in all soils investigated here. © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

Simple methods for the analysis of biochar in soil, however, are currently unavailable. Therefore, we have adapted the "loss on ignition" method for this purpose. The technique requires knowledge of the proportions of both biochar and biochar-free soil that are lost on ignition. One can use values determined prior to the amendment of the soil with biochar, assuming that the values do not change after biochar is incorporated in the soil. We tested these assumptions. Over the course of 15 months, the assumptions proved to be valid under our test conditions. The technique accurately determined a wide range of biochar concentrations in field soil. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

In situ measurements collected in the Soil Respiration Database (SRDB) number only a few hundred worldwide. Similarly, only a single datadriven wall-to-wall estimate of annual average heterotrophic respiration exists, based on bottom-up upscaling of SRDB measurements using an assumed functional form to account for climate variability. In this study, we exploit recent advances in remote sensing of terrestrial carbon fluxes to estimate global variations in heterotrophic respiration in a topdown fashion at monthly temporal resolution and 4° × 5° spatial resolution. We combine net ecosystem productivity estimates from atmospheric inversions of the NASA Carbon Monitoring System-Flux (CMS-Flux) with an optimally scaled gross primary productivity dataset based on satelliteobserved solar-induced fluorescence variations to estimate total ecosystem respiration as a residual of the terrestrial carbon balance. The ecosystem respiration is then separated into autotrophic and heterotrophic components based on a spatially varying carbon use efficiency retrieved in a model-data fusion framework (the CARbon DAta MOdel fraMework, CARDAMOM). The resulting dataset is independent of any assumptions about how heterotrophic respiration responds to climate or substrate variations. It estimates an annual average global average heterotrophic respiration flux of 43:6 ± 19:3 Pg C yr-1. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses showed that the top-down Rh are more sensitive to the choice of input gross primary productivity (GPP) and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) datasets than to the assumption of a static carbon use efficiency (CUE) value, with the possible exception of the wet tropics. These top-down estimates are compared to bottom-up estimates of annual heterotrophic respiration, using new uncertainty estimates that partially account for sampling and model errors. Top-down heterotrophic respiration estimates are higher than those from bottom-up upscaling everywhere except at high latitudes and are 30 \% greater overall (43.6 Pg C yr-1 vs. 33.4 Pg C yr-1). The uncertainty ranges of both methods are comparable, except poleward of 45° N, where bottom-up uncertainties are greater. The ratio of top-down heterotrophic to total ecosystem respiration varies seasonally by as much as 0.6 depending on season and climate, illustrating the importance of studying the drivers of autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration separately, and thus the importance of data-driven estimates of Rh such as those estimated here.},

  abstract = {As soil solutions pass through forested mineral soils, the chemical and structural compositions of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) can alter substantially due to interactions with soil particle surfaces. Typically, adsorption processes dominate in mineral soils and the resulting concentration of DOC is reduced substantially. We studied changes in the molecular and structural compositions of DOC during equilibration with mineral soils collected across Canada (n=43) and found that the overall aromatic content of DOC decreased with equilibration in almost all cases from using specific absorbance (SUVA) and the fluorescence index. The fluorescence index revealed that podzolic B horizons, with typically large adsorption capacity (Qmax), had the greatest reduction in aromaticity, which was partially explained by the much lower aromatic content of DOC desorbed from soils surfaces. In contrast, a decrease in DOC aromaticity for volcanic B horizons, also with high Qmax, was primarily due to adsorption. An unexpected finding was the release of extremely high (2.6×10 6Da) and low (420Da) molecular weight (MW) organic materials during equilibration using high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPLC), for luvisols and podzols, respectively. In general, the average number-average MW (M n) of DOC decreased for all soil types, but the greatest decrease in M n was observed for mineral soils with large Qmax, including the podzolic and volcanic B horizons. Analysis of changes in FTIR spectra revealed that the most prominent change to DOC functional groups was a reduction in carboxyl groups, which was even greater than the removal of aromatic DOC. The findings of this study emphasize that while DOC concentrations may decrease substantially during passage through mineral soils, it is valuable to consider the contribution of DOC from desorption of pre-existing soil C. Essential to the findings of this study was the inclusion of multiple analytical techniques to track changes to DOC character, and the inclusion of a wide range of mineral soils. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) were extracted from 0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm depth intervals from agricultural soils and analysed for their stable carbon isotopes (??13C values). The soils had been subjected to a vegetation change from C3 (??13C???-29.3???) to C4 plants (??13C???-12.5???) 40 years previously, which allowed us to trace the carbon flow from plant-derived input (litter, roots, and root exudates) into microbial PLFA. While bulk soil organic matter (SOM) reflected ???12\% of the C4-derived carbon in top soil (0-20 cm) and 3\% in deeper soil (40-60 cm), the PLFA had a much higher contribution of C4 carbon of about 64\% in 0-20 cm and 34\% in 40-60 cm. This implies a much faster turnover time of carbon in the microbial biomass compared to bulk SOM. The isotopic signature of bulk SOM and PLFA from C4 cultivated soil decreases with increasing soil depth (-23.7??? to -25.0??? for bulk SOM and -18.3??? to -23.3??? for PLFA), which demonstrates decreasing influence of the isotopic signature of the new C4 vegetation with soil depth. In terms of soil microbial carbon sources this clearly shows a high percentage of C4 labelled and thus young plant carbon as microbial carbon source in topsoils. With increasing soil depth this percentage decreases and SOM is increasingly used as microbial carbon source. Among all PLFA that were associated to different microbial groups it could be observed that (a) depended on availability, Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria prefer plant-derived carbon as carbon source, however, (b) Gram-positive bacteria use more SOM-derived carbon sources while Gram-negative bacteria use more plant biomass. This tendency was observed in all three-depth intervals. However, our results also show that microorganisms maintain their preferred carbon sources independent on soil depth with an isotopic shift of 3-4??? from 0-20 to 40-60 cm soil depth. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We took advantage of a multi-year experiment that manipulated the 14C isotope signature of surface leaf litter inputs in a temperate forest at the Oak Ridge Reservation, Tennessee, USA, to quantify the contribution of recent leaf litter C to microbial respiration and biomarkers in the underlying mineral soil. We observed no measurable difference ({$<$}∼40‰ given our current analytical methods) in the radiocarbon signatures of microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) isolated from the top 10cm of mineral soil in plots that experienced 3 years of litterfall that differed in each year by ∼750‰ between high-14C and low-14C treatments. Assuming any difference in 14C between the high- and low-14C plots would reflect C derived from these manipulated litter additions, we estimate that {$<$}∼6\% of the microbial C after 4 years was derived from the added 1-4-year-old surface litter. Large contributions of C from litter{$<$}1 year (or {$>$}4 years) old (which fell after (or prior to) the manipulation and therefore did not differ between plots) are not supported because the 14C signatures of the PLFA compounds (averaging 200-220‰) is much higher that of the 2004-5 leaf litter (115‰) or pre-2000 litter. A mesocosm experiment further demonstrated that C leached from 14C-enriched surface litter or the O horizon was not a detectable C source in underlying mineral soil microbes during the first eight months after litter addition. Instead a decline in the 14C of PLFA over the mesocosm experiment likely reflected the loss of a pre-existing substrate not associated with added leaf litter. Measured PLFA Δ14C signatures were higher than those measured in bulk mineral soil organic matter in our experiments, but fell within the range of 14C values measured in mineral soil roots. Together, our experiments suggest that root-derived C is the major ({$>$}60\%) source of C for microbes in these temperate deciduous forest soils. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The mechanisms governing organic carbon sequestration in soil remain poorly understood, yet are integral to understanding soil-climate feed- backs. We evaluated the biochemistry of dissolved and solid organic carbon in potential source and sink horizons across a chronosequence of volcanic soils in Hawai'i. The soils are derived from similar basaltic parent material on gently sloping volcanic shield surfaces, support the same vegetation assemblage, and yet exhibit strong shifts in soil mineralogy and soil carbon content as a function of volcanic substrate age. Solid-state13carbon nuclear magnetic reso- nance spectra indicate that the most persistent mineral-bound carbon is comprised of partially oxidized aromatic compounds with strong chemical resemblance to dissolved organic matter derived from plant litter. A molecular mix- ing model indicates that protein, lipid, carbohydrate, and char content decreased whereas oxidized lignin and car- boxyl/carbonyl content increased with increasing short-range order mineral content. When solutions rich in dissolved organic matter were passed through Bw-horizon mineral cores, aromatic compounds were preferentially sorbed with the greatest retention occurring in horizons containing the greatest amount of short-range ordered miner- als. These minerals are reactive metastable nanocrystals that are most common in volcanic soils, but exist in smaller amounts in nearly all major soil classes. Our results indicate that long-term carbon storage in short-range ordered minerals occurs via chemical retention with dissolved aromatic acids derived from plant litter and carried along preferential flow-paths to deeper B horizons.

  abstract = {Volcanic ash soils retain the largest and most persistent soil carbon pools of any ecosystem. However, the mechanisms governing soil carbon accumulation and weathering during initial phases of ecosystem development are not well understood. We examined soil organic matter dynamics and soil development across a high-altitude (3,560–3,030 m) 20-kyr climate gradient on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Four elevation sites were selected (\textbackslash textasciitilde250–500 mm rainfall), which range from sparsely vegetated to sites that contain a mix of shrubs and grasses. At each site, two or three pits were dug and major diagnostic horizons down to bedrock (intact lava) were sampled. Soils were analyzed for particle size, organic C and N, soil pH, exchangeable cations, base saturation, NaF pH, phosphorous sorption, and major elements. Mass loss and pedogenic metal accumulation (hydroxlamine Fe, Al, and Si extractions) were used to measure extent of weathering, leaching, changes in soil mineralogy and carbon accumulation. Reactive-phase (SRO) minerals show a general trend of increasing abundance with increasing rainfall. However carbon accumulation patterns across the climate gradient are largely decoupled from these trends. The results suggest that after 20 kyr, pedogenic processes have altered the nature and composition of the volcanic ash such that it is capable of retaining soil C even where organic acid influences from plant material and leaching from rainfall are severely limited. Carbon storage comparisons with lower-elevation soils on Mauna Kea and other moist mesic (2,500 mm rainfall) sites on Hawaii suggest that these soils have reached only between 1\% and 15\% of their capacity to retain carbon. Our results suggest that, after 20 kyr in low rainfall and a cold climate, weathering was decoupled from soil carbon accumulation patterns and the associated influence of vegetation on soil development. Overall, we conclude that the rate of carbon supply to the subsoil (driven by coupling of rainfall above ground plant production) is a governing factor of forms and amount of soil organic matter accumulation, while soil mineralogy remained relatively uniform.},

The parallel trend in organic matter composition with soil depth and during plant residue decay has been used as evidence to suggest that organic products accumulate or develop in the subsoil due to increasing intensity of microbially-driven processing, although no studies to date have verified this. Here, by applying sequential density fractionation, specific surface area, oxalate extractable Fe and Al, C:N and δ15N measures with depth to soils with relatively uniform soil mineralogy (Oxisols), climates and vegetation we show that changes in organo-mineral associations drive subsoil C:N and δ15N and C:N depth patterns more than in situ organic matter decay.

Data on easily measured secondary variables that are strongly related to soil C are believed to be helpful in improving mapping accuracy. The objective of this study was to assess improvement in mapping accuracy due to dense topographical and long-term yield monitoring information. Approximately 1200 total C measurements at the 0- to 5-cm depth along with topographical and 7-yr crop grain yield data were collected at twelve 60- by 60-m plots at the Long-Term Ecological Research Site in Michigan. Total C was found to be significantly related to topography and 7-yr average standardized yield in all studied plots, with regression R 2 {$>$}0.5 in approximately half of the plots. Accounting for either topographical or yield information in regression kriging, however, produced only modest ({$<$}10\%) improvement in mapping accuracy compared with ordinary kriging. Plots with promisingly strong relationships of total C with topography or yield were also found to be the ones where spatial distributions of total C were highly continuous, thus leading to no advantages in using regression kriging. The results indicated that under soil and topographical conditions similar to those of this study, dense topographical data or dense long-term yield data might not lead to substantial improvement in C mapping accuracy.},

  abstract = {Whole soil profile assessments of soil C stocks are enormously important for evaluating a soil's potential for sequestering C. Carbon stock measurements are often highly variable, which makes the detection of statistically significant differences among different land uses and management systems difficult. A common mistake is to interpret a lack of statistical significance as evidence for the absence of differences. This mistake is costly: failure to identify practices and habitats that accumulate C can affect our understanding of soil C cycling and hide possible sequestration potentials. In this study, we investigated inadequate replication as a major cause of a lack of statistical significance. Power analysis is a well-established statistical tool that allows researchers to infer whether the lack of statistical significance is due to the absence of meaningful differences or due to insufficient replication. We used data from two published studies to illustrate the value of power analysis. In particular, we showed that in these studies the chances of detecting even substantial (e.g., 50\%) differences among experimental treatments can be as low as 20 to 60\% due to the natural variability in soil C concentrations and stocks. Carbon variability in different soil horizons suggests that statistical analyses of soil C stocks should be conducted separately for each sampled horizon and that conclusions about the profile as a whole should be made based on the individual horizon results. Devising an optimal sampling strategy that identifies the appropriate number of replicates needed to detect significant C change by horizon is essential.},

Well-recognized approaches for soil C accretion include reducing soil disturbance, increasing plant biomass inputs, and enhancing plant diversity. Yet experimental evidence often fails to support anticipated C gains, suggesting that our integrated understanding of soil C accretion remains insufficient. Here we use a unique combination of X-ray micro-tomography and micro-scale enzyme mapping to demonstrate for the first time that plant-stimulated soil pore formation appears to be a major, hitherto unrecognized, determinant of whether new C inputs are stored or lost to the atmosphere. Unlike monocultures, diverse plant communities favor the development of 30–150 µm pores. Such pores are the micro-environments associated with higher enzyme activities, and greater abundance of such pores translates into a greater spatial footprint that microorganisms make on the soil and consequently soil C storage capacity.},

In this study we used soil 2D zymography and X-ray computed tomography (μCT) to assess the relationship between enzymes and pores. The objectives of the study were (i) to assess spatial distribution patterns in the activity of six enzymes contributing to C, N and P cycles, namely, cellobiohydrolase, β-glucosidase, xylanase acid phosphatase, leucine aminopeptidase, and N-acetylglucosaminidase, in soils from five long-term land use and management practices, (ii) to study the correlation between enzyme activities and μCT information, i.e., pore characteristics and image grayscale values, and (iii) to explore the potential use of soil 2D zymography in predicting enzyme activities within 3D soil cores. 3D pore-size distributions were obtained from μCT images of 13 intact soil cores and then 8–15 2D zymography maps were taken from each core. Spatial distributions in the activities of all studied enzymes were auto-correlated; the spatial correlation ranges were equal to ∼7–8 mm. The relative activity of all enzymes was positively associated within 60–180 μm Ø pores. Combining 3D μCT information with 2D zymography maps visualized the overall patterns of enzyme activity distributions with respect to soil pores and particulate organic matter locations. Based on the findings we propose a conceptual scheme relating localization of microorganisms, enzymes and substrates to pores of different size ranges. Specifically, we suggest that pores in the tens of microns size range represent optimal microbial habitats, and as such are associated with greater microbial abundance, leading to high enzyme production and activity.},

Composite coring (core) and excavation mensuration (pit) techniques were per- formed in glacially stratified Inceptisols of southern New England. Estimates of total C pool size (forest floor [FF] ?15 cm) from the pit and core techniques were significantly correlated (r2 ? 0.61, P ? 0.0001) and very similar (5.64 ? 0.32 and 5.63 ? 0.29, respectively). However, the core technique reduced variance in the sample popula- tion, allowing fewer samples to detect a10\%change in nutrient storage (21 core vs. 29 pit samples). In addition, sampling each plot with the core technique required less than one-half the sampling time of the pit technique. The pit technique, however, allowed quantitative sampling below 15 cm and direct measurement of large coarse fragments. Data from the pit technique revealed a strong exponential decline in nutri- ent storage with depth. This exponential decline allowed the extrapola- tion of C and N pools to greater depths. Carbon storage (kg m?2 ) was described by depth (cm) as: exp (5.53–0.04 depth); P ? 0.0001. N storage (kg m?2 ) was described by depth (cm) and tree basal area (ba, m2 ha?1 ) as: exp (3.280–0.025 depth– 0.003 ba); P ? 0.0001. Our data suggest that composite core sampling is more efficient than, but well supplemented by, pit sampling. F},

  abstract = {The methods used for estimating below-ground carbon (C) translocation by plants, and the results obtained for different plant species are reviewed. Three tracer techniques using C isotopes to quantify root-derived C are discussed: pulse labeling, continuous labeling, and a method based on the difference in 13C natural abundance in C3 and C4 plants. It is shown, that only the tracer methods provided adequate results for the whole below-ground C translocation. This included roots, exudates and other organic substances, quickly decomposable by soil microorganisms, and CO2 produced by root respiration. Advantages due to coupling of two different tracer techniques are shown. The differences in the below-ground C translocation pattern between plant species (cereals, grasses, and trees) are discussed. Cereals (wheat and barley) transfer 20\%-30\% of total assimilated C into the soil. Half of this amount is subsequently found in the roots and about one-third in CO2 evolved from the soil by root respiration and microbial utilization of rootborne organic substances. The remaining part of below-ground translocated C is incorporated into the soil microorganisms and soil organic matter. The portion of assimilated C allocated below the ground by cereals decreases during growth and by increasing N fertilization. Pasture plants translocated about 30\%-50\% of assimilates below-ground, and their translocation patterns were similar to those of crop plants. On average, the total C amounts translocated into the soil by cereals and pasture plants are approximately the same (1500 kg C ha-1), when the same growth period is considered. However, during one vegetation period the cereals and grasses allocated beneath the ground about 1500 and 2200kg C ha-1, respectively. Finally, a simple approach is suggested for a rough calculation of C input into the soil and for root-derived CO2 efflux from the soil.},

  abstract = {In this re-evaluation of our 10-year old paper on priming effects, I have considered the latest studies and tried to identify the most important needs for future research. Recent publications have shown that the increase or decrease in soil organic matter mineralization (measured as changes of CO 2 efflux and N mineralization) actually results from interactions between living (microbial biomass) and dead organic matter. The priming effect (PE) is not an artifact of incubation studies, as sometimes supposed, but is a natural process sequence in the rhizosphere and detritusphere that is induced by pulses or continuous inputs of fresh organics. The intensity of turnover processes in such hotspots is at least one order of magnitude higher than in the bulk soil. Various prerequisites for high-quality, informative PE studies are outlined: calculating the budget of labeled and total C; investigating the dynamics of released CO 2 and its sources; linking C and N dynamics with microbial biomass changes and enzyme activities; evaluating apparent and real PEs; and assessing PE sources as related to soil organic matter stabilization mechanisms. Different approaches for identifying priming, based on the assessment of more than two C sources in CO 2 and microbial biomass, are proposed and methodological and statistical uncertainties in PE estimation and approaches to eliminating them are discussed. Future studies should evaluate directions and magnitude of PEs according to expected climate and land-use changes and the increased rhizodeposition under elevated CO 2 as well as clarifying the ecological significance of PEs in natural and agricultural ecosystems. The conclusion is that PEs - the interactions between living and dead organic matter - should be incorporated in models of C and N dynamics, and that microbial biomass should regarded not only as a C pool but also as an active driver of C and N turnover. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a key element of agroecosystems functioning and has a crucial impact on global carbon storage. At the landscape scale, SOC spatial variability is strongly affected by natural and anthropogenic processes and linear anthropogenic elements (such hedges or ditches). This study aims at mapping SOC stocks distribution in the A-horizons for a depth up to 105cm, at a high spatial resolution, for an area of 10km2 in a heterogeneous agricultural landscape (North-Western France). We used a data mining tool, Cubist, to build rule-based predictive models and predict SOC content and soil bulk density (BD) from a calibration dataset at 8 standard layers (0 to 7.5cm, 7.5 to 15cm, 15 to 30cm, 30 to 45cm, 45 to 60cm, 60 to 75cm, 75 to 90cm and 90 to 105cm). For the models calibration, 70 sampling locations were selected within the whole study area using the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling method. Two independent validation datasets were used to assess the performance of the predictive models: (i) at landscape scale, 49 sampling locations were selected using stratified random sampling based on a 300-m square grid; (ii) at hedge vicinity, 112 sampling locations were selected along transects perpendicular to 14 purposively chosen hedges. Undisturbed samples were collected at fixed depths and analysed for BD and SOC content at each sampling location and continuous soil profiles were reconstructed using equal-area splines. Predictive environmental data consisted in attributes derived from a light detection and ranging digital elevation model (LiDAR DEM), geological variables, land use data and a predictive map of A-horizon thickness. Considering the two validation datasets (at landscape scale and hedge vicinity), root mean square errors (RMSE) of the predictions, computed for all the standard soil layers (up to a depth of 105cm), were respectively 7.74 and 5.02gkg-1 for SOC content, and 0.15 and 0.21gcm-3 for BD. Best predictions were obtained for layers between 15 and 60cm of depth. The SOC stocks were calculated over a depth of 105cm by combining the prediction of SOC content and BD. The final maps show that the carbon stocks in the soil below 30cm accounted for 33\% of the total SOC stocks on average. The whole method produced consistent results between the two predicted soil properties. The final SOC stocks maps provide continuous data along soil profile up to 105cm, which may be critical information for supporting carbon policy and management decisions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The objectives of this study were to (i) assess the relative usefulness of TOC, POC, and SMC as criteria of management induced changes on soil C and (ii) investigate if using auxiliary soil and topographical information can aid in increasing the usefulness of these criteria in studies conducted across large spatial scales. Data were collected at locations with two contrasting topographical positions (slope and depression) within 10 agricultural fields in conventional and cover crop based row crop managements at the 0- to 20-, 35- to 50-, and 70- to 90-cm depths. The results showed that to detect differences between the management systems with an acceptable type II error of 0.20, an 80\% difference in TOC and a 50\% difference in SMC were needed. The statistical power for POC was never in an acceptable range. The use of auxiliary soil and topography information via analysis of covariance decreased the sizes of the minimal detectable differences. Given the faster reaction to management of SMC as compared with TOC, and its lower variability as compared with POC, we recommend SMC as the preferred C fraction for detecting treatment induced differences in organic C stocks in agricultural field experiments, especially in deeper soil layers.},

  abstract = {Models of ecosystem carbon (C) balance generally assume a strong relationship between NPP, litter inputs, and soil C accumulation, but there is little direct evidence for such a coupled relationship. Using a unique 50-year detrital manipulation experiment in a mixed deciduous forest and in restored prairie grasslands in Wisconsin, combined with sequential density fractionation, isotopic analysis, and short-term incubation, we examined the effects of detrital inputs and removals on soil C stabilization, destabilization, and quality. Both forested sites showed greater decline in bulk soil C content in litter removal plots (55 and 66 \%) compared to increases in litter addition plots (27 and 38 \% increase in surface soils compared to controls). No accumulation in the mineral fraction C was observed after 50 years of litter addition of the two forested plots, thus increases in the light density fraction pool drove patterns in total C content. Litter removal across both ecosystem types resulted in a decline in both free light fraction and mineral C content, with an overall 51 \% decline in mineral-associated carbon in the intermediate (1.85-2.4 g cm-3) density pool; isotopic data suggest that it was preferentially younger C that was lost. In contrast to results from other, but younger litter manipulation sites, there was with no evidence of priming even in soils collected after 28 years of treatment. In prairie soils, aboveground litter exclusion had an effect on C levels similar to that of root exclusion, thus we did not see evidence that root-derived C is more critical to soil C sequestration. There was no clear evidence that soil C quality changed in litter addition plots in the forested sites; ?13C and ?14C values, and incubation estimates of labile C were similar between control and litter addition soils. C quality appeared to change in litter removal plots; soils with litter excluded had ?14C values indicative of longer mean residence times, ?13C values indicative of loss of fresh plant-derived C, and decreases in all light fraction C pools, although incubation estimates of labile C did not change. In prairie soils, ?13C values suggest a loss of recent C4-derived soil C in litter removal plots along with significant increases in mean residence time, especially in plots with removal of roots. Our results suggest surface mineral soils may be vulnerable to significant C loss in association with disturbance, land use change, or perhaps even climate change over century-decadal timescales, and also highlight the need for longer-term experimental manipulations to study soil organic matter dynamics. ? 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

  abstract = {Ecological research networks functioning across climatic and edaphic gradients are critical for improving predictive understanding of biogeochemical cycles at local through global scales. One international network, the Detrital Input and Removal Treatment (DIRT) Project, was established to assess how rates and sources of plant litter inputs influence accumulations or losses of organic matter in forest soils. DIRT employs chronic additions and exclusions of aboveground litter inputs and exclusion of root ingrowth to permanent plots at eight forested and two shrub/grass sites to investigate how soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics are influenced by plant detrital inputs across ecosystem and soil types. Across the DIRT network described here, SOM pools responded only slightly, or not at all, to chronic doubling of aboveground litter inputs. Explanations for the slow or even negative response of SOM to litter additions include increased decomposition of new inputs and priming of old SOM. Evidence of priming includes increased soil respiration in litter addition plots, decreased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) output from increased microbial activity, and biochemical markers in soil indicating enhanced SOM degradation. SOM pools decreased in response to chronic exclusion of aboveground litter, which had a greater effect on soil C than did excluding roots, providing evidence that root-derived C is not more critical than aboveground litter C to soil C sequestration. Partitioning of belowground contributions to total soil respiration were predictable based on site-level soil C and N as estimates of site fertility; contributions to soil respiration from root respiration were negatively related to soil fertility and inversely, contributions from decomposing aboveground litter in soil were positively related to site fertility. The commonality of approaches and manipulations across the DIRT network has provided greater insights into soil C cycling than could have been revealed at a single site.},

SOM is a source of atmospheric CO(2), with the use of extractive farming practices that lead to a negative nutrient balance and exacerbate soil degradation. The historic loss of C from the SOM pool between the 1850s and 2000 is estimated at 78 +/- 12 Gt compared with the emission of 270 +/- 30 Gt from fossil fuel combustion. Despite its numerous direct and ancillary benefits, enhancing the SOM pool is a major challenge, especially in impoverished and depleted soils in harsh tropical climates. In addition to biophysical factors, there are also numerous social, economic and political constraints that limit increase in SOM pools. Conversion of plough-tillage to no-till farming, an important practice to enhance the SOM pool, is constrained by the limited access to herbicides and seed drill, and the competing uses of crop residues. Yet, enhancing the SOM pool is essential to restoring degraded soils, advancing food security and improving the environment. Important subjects among researchable topics include: assessing the rate of SOM accretion for a wide range of land use and management practices with reference to a baseline; evaluating the importance of biochar; measuring and predicting SOM at landscape and extrapolation to regional scale; establishing relationships between SOM and soil quality and agronomic productivity; determining on- and off-site effects of crop residues removal for ethanol/biofuel production; determining the fate of C in SOM translocated by erosional processes; evaluating nutrient requirements for increasing SOM in croplands; validating predictive models in tropical environments; and developing methodology for trading C credits.},

Many plant species have a distinct ecological amplitude that shows restriction to specific soil types. In the numerous interactions between plants and soil, microorganisms also play a key role. Here we review the existing literature on interactions between plants, microorganisms and soils, and include considerations of evolutionary time scales, where possible. Some of these interactions involve intricate systems of communication, which in the case of symbioses such as the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis are several hundreds of millions years old; others involve the release of exudates from roots, and other products of rhizodeposition that are used as substrates for soil microorganisms. The possible reasons for the survival value of this loss of carbon over tens or hundreds of millions of years of evolution of higher plants are discussed, taking a cost-benefit approach. Co-evolution of plants and rhizosphere microorganisms is discussed, in the light of known ecological interactions between various partners in terrestrial ecosystems. Finally, the role of higher plants, especially deep-rooted plants and associated microorganisms in the weathering of rocks and minerals, ultimately contributing to pedogenesis, is addressed. We show that rhizosphere processes in the long run are central to biogeochemical cycles, soil formation and Earth history. Major anticipated discoveries will enhance our basic understanding and allow applications of new knowledge to deal with nutrient deficiencies, pests and diseases, and the challenges of increasing global food production and agroecosystem productivity in an environmentally responsible manner.},

  abstract = {Soil acidification and N saturation are considered to affect the decomposition of soil organic matter as well as growth and mortality of fine roots in many forest soils. Here we report from a field experiment where 'clean rain' has been applied to the soil for about 10 years under a roofed plot of a 71-year-old Norway spruce plantation at Solling, Central Germany. Reduced amounts of protons (-78\%), sulphate (-53\%), ammonium (-86\%), and nitrate (-49\%) were sprayed on the soil surface of the clean rain plot between 1992 and 2001. In an adjacent roofed control plot, throughfall was collected and immediately re-sprinkled below the roof construction without any chemical manipulation. One year before the clean rain treatment started, live and dead fine root masses (≤2 mm) were determined from undisturbed soil cores down to 40 cm mineral soil depth. Total live fine root mass was significantly lower in the clean rain plot than in the control plot. After the first sampling, the soil holes were refilled with quartz sand and repeatedly sampled in June 1992, June 1996, and October 2001. There were no differences in live and dead fine root masses between the plots in 1992 and 1996. In 2001, both live and dead fine root masses of the clean rain plot were about twice as high as in the control plot, indicating that fine root growth recovered in the mineral soil following 10 years of clean rain treatment. Moreover, the clean rain treatment significantly reduced the total N concentrations of live fine roots and 1-year-old needles. Our results suggest that the reduced N input promoted fine root growth to compensate N deficiency. Reduced Al concentration in soil solution may have contributed to the recovery of fine root growth, however, the toxicity of Al species is largely unknown. Mean annual soil respiration rate was 24\% higher in the period from 2000 to 2001, indicating that the clean rain treatment increased respiration of roots and heterotrophic microorganisms within the rhizosphere. Laboratory incubation of samples from the organic horizon and the top mineral soil revealed no differences between the plots in the decay rate of soil organic matter. Our results suggest that strong reductions in atmospheric N deposition from about 30 to 10 kg N ha-1 yr-1 and decreasing acid stress can have beneficial effects on growth of fine roots in the mineral soil within a decade. We conclude that biological recovery under reduced atmospheric loads can affect the nutrient and carbon budget of spruce soils in the long run. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {Soil systems are known to be repositories for atmospheric carbon and metal contaminants, but the complex processes that regulate the introduction, migration and fate of atmospheric elements in soils are poorly understood. This gap in knowledge is attributable, in part, to the lack of an established chronometer that is required for quantifying rates of relevant processes. Here we develop and test a framework for adapting atmospheric lead-210 chronometry (210Pb; half-life 22 years) to soil systems. We propose a new empirical model, the Linked Radionuclide aCcumulation model (LRC, aka "lark"), that incorporates measurements of beryllium-7 (7Be; half-life 54 days) to account for 210Pb penetration of the soil surface during initial deposition, a process which is endemic to soils but omitted from conventional 210Pb models (e.g., the Constant Rate of Supply, CRS model) and their application to sedimentary systems. We validate the LRC model using the 1963-1964 peak in bomb-fallout americium-241 (241Am; half-life of 432 years) as an independent, corroborating time marker. In three different soils we locate a sharp 241Am weapons horizon at disparate depths ranging from 2.5 to 6 cm, but with concordant ages averaging 1967 ± 4 via the LRC model. Similarly, at one site contaminated with mercury (HgT) we find that the LRC model is consistent with the recorded history of Hg emission. The close agreement of Pb, Am and Hg behavior demonstrated here suggests that organo-metallic colloid formation and migration incorporates many trace metals in universal soil processes and that these processes may be described quantitatively using atmospheric 210Pb chronometry. The 210Pb models evaluated here show that migration rates of soil colloids on the order of 1 mm yr-1 are typical, but also that these rates vary systematically with depth and are attributable to horizon-specific processes of leaf-litter decay, eluviation and illuviation. We thus interpret 210Pb models to quantify (i) exposure of the soil system to atmospheric aerosol deposition in the context of (ii) organic carbon assimilation, colloid production, and advection through the soil profile. The behavior of some other elements, such as Cs, diverges from the conservative colloid behavior exemplified by Pb and Am, and in these cases the value of empirical 210Pb chronometry models like LRC and CRS is as a comparator rather than as an absolute chronometer. We conclude that 210Pb chronometry is valuable for tracing colloidally-mediated transport of Pb and similarly-refractory metals, as well as the mobile pool of carbon in soils.},

  abstract = {Geostatistical estimates of a soil property by kriging are equivalent to the best linear unbiased predictions (BLUPs). Universal kriging is BLUP with a fixed-effect model that is some linear function of spatial co- ordinates, or more generally a linear function of some other secondary predictor variable when it is called kriging with external drift. A problem in universal kriging is to find a spatial variance model for the random variation, since empirical variograms estimated from the data by method-of-moments will be affected by both the random variation and that variation represented by the fixed effects. The geostatistical model of spatial variation is a special case of the linear mixed model where our data are modelled as the additive combination of fixed effects (e.g. the unknown mean, coefficients of a trend model), random effects (the spatially dependent random variation in the geostatistical context) and independent random error (nugget variation in geostatistics). Statisticians use residual maximum like- lihood (REML) to estimate variance parameters, i.e. to obtain the variogram in a geostatistical context. REML estimates are consistent (they converge in probability to the parameters that are estimated) with less bias than both maximum likelihood estimates and method-of-moment estimates obtained from residuals of a fitted trend. If the estimate of the random effects variance model is inserted into the BLUP we have the empirical BLUP or E-BLUP. Despite representing the state of the art for prediction from a linear mixed model in statistics, the REML–E-BLUP has not been widely used in soil science, and in most studies reported in the soils literature the variogram is estimated with methods that are seriously biased if the fixed-effect structure is more complex than just an unknown constant mean (ordinary kriging). In this paper we describe the REML–E-BLUP and illustrate the method with some data on soil water content that exhibit a pronounced spatial trend},

The reason is that the variogram required for the kriging must be of residuals from any trend, which in turn cannot be estimated optimally by the usual method of trend surface analysis because the residuals are correlated. The difficulties can be overcome by the use of residual maximum likelihood (REML) to estimate both the trend and the variogram of the residuals simultaneously.We summarize the theory of REML as it applies to kriging in the presence of trend. We present the equations to show how estimates of the trend are combined with kriging of residuals to give empirical best linear unbiased predictions (E-BLUPs). We then apply the method to estimate the height of the sub-Upper-Chalk surface beneath the Chiltern Hills of southeast England from 238 borehole data. The variogram of the REML residuals is substantially different from that computed by ordinary least squares (OLS) analysis. The map of the predicted surface is similar to that made from kriging with the OLS variogram. The variances, however, are substantially larger because (a) they derive from a variogram with a much larger sill and (b) they include the uncertainty of the estimate of the trend.},

The design of sampling protocols for soil survey must meet these dual requirements. This paper emphasizes that the status and change of an indicator are different variables and so their variability may differ. We therefore may not assume that a sampling scheme that is suitable for inventory is also suitable for monitoring; this poses a practical problem since information on the variability of the change in soil is not in general available at present. In this paper some plausible statistical models of change in the soil are examined, and their implications for sampling to estimate mean change in large regions are considered. Paired sampling, with baseline and resampling at common sites, is generally preferable to sampling at independent sites on the two dates, unless the error from relocation of the sample sites is large by comparison to other sources of variation. A simple process model of soil organic carbon in soils of lowland tropical forest is used to examine the problem of resampling to estimate change. This shows the expected advantages of paired sampling for change, and the very different sampling requirements that may pertain for inventory and monitoring. One implication of these results is that, while sampling schemes for inventory may be designed on the basis of available information (from samples taken at a single time), the precise requirements for monitoring might not be apparent until a reconnaissance resampling is undertaken subsequently.},

Quantitative models of organic matter degradation are therefore essential for understanding the chemical state and evolution of the Earth's near-surface environment, and to forecast the biogeochemical consequences of ongoing regional and global change. The complex nature of biologically produced organic matter represents a major obstacle to the development of such models, however. Here, we compare the energetics of the oxidative degradation of a large number of naturally occurring organic compounds. By relating the Gibbs energies of half reactions describing the complete mineralization of the compounds to their average nominal carbon oxidation state, it becomes possible to estimate the energetic potential of the compounds based on major element (C, H, N, O, P, S) ratios. The new energetic description of organic matter can be combined with bioenergetic theory to rationalize observed patterns in the decomposition of natural organic matter. For example, the persistence of cell membrane derived compounds and complex organics in anoxic settings is consistent with their limited catabolic potential under these environmental conditions. The proposed approach opens the way to include the thermodynamic properties of organic compounds in kinetic models of organic matter degradation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) is a key component of the global carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles, but the processes controlling its formation from plant litter are not well understood. Recent evidence suggests that more MAOM will form from higher quality litters (e.g., those with lower C/N ratios and lower lignocellulose indices), than lower quality litters. Shoots and roots of the same non-woody plant can provide good examples of high and low quality litters, respectively, yet previous work tends to show a majority of soil organic matter is root-derived. We investigated the effect of litter quality on MAOM formation from shoots versus roots using a litter-soil slurry incubation of isotopically labeled ( 13 C and 15 N) shoots or roots of Big Bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) with isolated silt or clay soil fractions. The slurry method minimized the influence of soil structure and maximized contact between plant material and soil. We tracked the contribution of shoot- and root-derived C and N to newly formed MAOM over 60 days. We found that shoots contributed more C and N to MAOM than roots. The formation of shoot-derived MAOM was also more efficient, meaning that less CO 2 was respired per unit MAOM formed. We suggest that these results are driven by initial differences in litter chemistry between the shoot and root material, while results of studies showing a majority of soil organic matter is root-derived may be driven by alternate mechanisms, such as proximity of roots to mineral surfaces, greater contribution of roots to aggregate formation, and root exudation. Across all treatments, newly formed MAOM had a low C/N ratio compared to the parent plant material, which supports the idea that microbial processing of litter is a key pathway of MAOM formation.},

However, SOM is incredibly complex and requires separation into multiple components with contrasting behavior in order to study and predict its dynamics. Numerous diverse SOM separation schemes are currently used, making cross-study comparisons difficult and hindering broad-scale generalizations. Here, we recommend separating SOM into particulate (POM) and mineral-associated (MAOM) forms, two SOM components that are fundamentally different in terms of their formation, persistence, and functioning. We provide evidence of their highly contrasting physical and chemical properties, mean residence times in soil, and responses to land use change, plant litter inputs, warming, CO2 enrichment, and N fertilization. Conceptualizing SOM into POM versus MAOM is a feasible, well-supported, and useful framework that will allow scientists to move beyond studies of bulk SOM, but also use a consistent separation scheme across studies. Ultimately, we propose the POM versus MAOM framework as the best way forward to understand and predict broad-scale SOM dynamics in the context of global change challenges and provide necessary recommendations to managers and policy makers.},

Astringency and sourness decreased with increasing pH. However, acids were differentially sour at equal pH, consistent with previous findings. In contrast, the tactile attributes associated with astringency (drying, roughing of oral tissues and puckery/tightening sensations) were similar across acids; pH was the major influence on astringency. Strong dependence on pH suggests that astringency of these acids is a direct result of their acidic properties, and not solely due to the hydrogen bonding mechanisms previously suggested as an explanation of astringency in tannin interactions with salivary proteins.},

  abstract = {Biological inputs and organic matter cycling have long been regarded as important factors in the physical and chemical development of soils. In particular, the extent to which low molecular weight organic acids, such as oxalate, influence geochemical reactions has been widely studied. Although the effects of organic acids are diverse, there is strong evidence that organic acids accelerate the dissolution of some minerals. However, the influence of organic acids at the field-scale and over the timescales of soil development has not been evaluated in detail. In this study, a reactive-transport model of soil chemical weathering and pedogenic development was used to quantify the extent to which organic acid cycling controls mineral dissolution rates and long-term patterns of chemical weathering. Specifically, oxalic acid was added to simulations of soil development to investigate a well-studied chronosequence of soils near Santa Cruz, CA. The model formulation includes organic acid input, transport, decomposition, organic-metal aqueous complexation and mineral surface complexation in various combinations. Results suggest that although organic acid reactions accelerate mineral dissolution rates near the soil surface, the net response is an overall decrease in chemical weathering. Model results demonstrate the importance of organic acid input concentrations, fluid flow, decomposition and secondary mineral precipitation rates on the evolution of mineral weathering fronts. In particular, model soil profile evolution is sensitive to kaolinite precipitation and oxalate decomposition rates. The soil profile-scale modeling presented here provides insights into the influence of organic carbon cycling on soil weathering and pedogenesis and supports the need for further field-scale measurements of the flux and speciation of reactive organic compounds. © 2014.},

In this study, an extensive dataset of soil profile chemistry and mineralogy is compiled from the Cowlitz River Chronosequence (CRC), WA USA. The CRC soils range in age from 0.25 to 1200kyr, spanning a developmental gradient encompassing clear changes in soil mineralogy, chemistry, and surface area. Comparison of these and other metrics of soil development with SOC properties reveal several relationships that may be diagnostic of the long-term coupling of soil development and C cycling. Specifically, SOC content was significantly correlated with sodium pyrophosphate extractable metals emphasizing the relevance of organo-metal complexes in volcanic soils. The depth distributions of organo-metals and other secondary weathering products, including the kaolin and short-range order (SRO) minerals, support the so-called "binary composition" of volcanic soils. The formation of organo-metal complexes limits the accumulation of secondary minerals in shallow soils, whereas in deep soils with lower SOC content, secondary minerals accumulate. In the CRC soils, secondary minerals formed in deep soils (below 50cm) including smectite, allophane, Fe-oxides and dominated by the kaolin mineral halloysite. The abundance of halloysite was significantly correlated with bulk soil surface area and14C content (a proxy for the mean age of SOC), implying enhanced stability of C in deep soils. Allophane, an SRO mineral commonly associated with SOC storage, was not correlated with SOC content or14C values in CRC soils. We propose conceptual framework to describe these observations based on a general understanding of pedogenesis in volcanic soils, where SOC cycling is coupled with soil development through the formation of and fate of organo-metal or other mobile weathering products. This framework highlights interactions between SOC and soil development, which may be applicable to other soils where organic inputs interact with the products of chemical weathering.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Radiocarbon is a critical constraint on our estimates of the timescales of soil carbon cycling that can aid in identifying mechanisms of carbon stabilization and destabilization, and improve forecast of soil carbon response to management or environmental change. Despite the wealth of soil radiocarbon data that has been reported over the past 75 years, the ability to apply these data to global scale questions is limited by our capacity to synthesis and compare measurements generated using a variety of methods. Here we describe the International Soil Radiocarbon Database (ISRaD, soilradiocarbon.org), an open-source archive of soils data that include data from bulk soils, or whole-soils; distinct soil carbon pools isolated in the laboratory by a variety of soil fractionation methods; samples of soil gas or water collected interstitially from within an intact soil profile; CO2 gas isolated from laboratory soil incubations; and fluxes collected in situ from a soil surface. The core of ISRaD is a relational database structured around individual datasets (entries) and organized hierarchically to report soil radiocarbon data, measured at different physical and temporal scales, as well as other soil or environmental properties that may also be measured at one or more levels of the hierarchy that may assist with interpretation and context. Anyone may contribute their own data to the database by entering it into the ISRaD template and subjecting it to quality assurance protocols. ISRaD can be accessed through: (1) a web-based interface, (2) an R package (ISRaD), or (3) direct access to code and data through the GitHub repository, which hosts both code and data. The design of ISRaD allows for participants to become directly involved in the management, design, and application of ISRaD data. The synthesized dataset is available in two forms: the original data as reported by the authors of the datasets; and an enhanced dataset that includes ancillary geospatial data calculated within the ISRaD framework. ISRaD also provides data management tools in the ISRaD-R package that provide a starting point for data analysis. This community-based dataset and platform for soil radiocarbon and a wide array of additional soils data information in soils where data are easy to contribute and the community is invited to add tools and ideas for improvement. As a whole, ISRaD provides resources that can aid our evaluation of soil dynamics and improve our understanding of controls on soil carbon dynamics across a range of spatial and temporal scales. The ISRaD v1.0 dataset (Lawrence et al., 2019) is archived and freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2613911.},

  abstract = {It has been postulated that the amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) associated with soil minerals exhibits a threshold relationship in response to effective soil moisture (estimated as precipitation less evapotranspiration). To better characterize the role of moisture in influencing mechanisms of SOC storage during pedogenesis, we compare soils from two different chronosequence sites: the Santa Cruz and Mattole River marine terraces that together form a soil age-by-climate gradient (i.e., climo-chronosequence). Our results demonstrate how variation in the effective soil moisture may drive soil development along divergent pedogenic trajectories, resulting in variations in the form and depth distribution of secondary weathering products. In particular, the residual metals Fe and Al are directly related to the type of secondary minerals that accumulate during weathering, and these variations are coupled to differences in the storage and long-term preservation of SOC both within and between soils. Over time, these differences in soil development may lead to ?pedogenic thresholds? that further differentiate soil characteristics and influence SOC dynamics. In this case, the pedogenic threshold takes the form of clay-rich argillic horizons that once formed, inhibit aqueous transport, decouple shallow and deep soil environments, and potentially limit SOC inputs and increase microbial recycling in deep soils. Our data suggest argillic horizon development is favorable in the drier Santa Cruz soils, where kaolinite is the dominant secondary weathering product. In contrast, greater available moisture in soils of the Mattole chronosequence drive a different weathering trajectory characterized by the accumulation of more amorphous secondary minerals. As a result, the Mattole soils and do not exhibit argillic horizon development but are instead characterized by greater accumulation of SOC across all depths sampled. Overall, our results illustrate how the interaction of climate (i.e., moisture) and time may shape the trajectory of soil development and the dynamics of SOC storage and preservation.},

  abstract = {Soil profiles from undisturbed grassland sites around the Great Plains of the USA were sampled for analysis of soil organic carbon (SOC) content (\%), radiocarbon age and stable-carbon isotope composition (δ13C). With the exception of a few pronounced dating anomalies, SOC radiocarbon age generally increases steadily with depth back to 10-15,000 cal yr BP, the deepest soil intervals in 9 of the 12 sites. The radiocarbon ages were used to establish the chronology of changes in past plant distribution over time and space, based on SOC δ13C as an indicator of C3 and C4 plant abundance. Changes were referenced to an SOC δ13C value of -20‰, which is the approximate mid-point between C3 and C4 carbon isotope composition, i.e., an equal mixture of C3 and C4 carbon. Prior to 10,000 cal yr BP, the region was dominated by C3 plants with the exception of the southernmost Texas sites. From 10,000 to 2000 cal yr BP, C4 plants expanded their range, initially as a peninsula of C4-predominant grasses extending northeastward and ultimately dominating all but the northernmost border of the region. Finally, the C3-predominant region re-expanded after 1000 cal yr BP, perhaps as a response to the Little Ice Age cooling. Despite uncertainties associated with using radiocarbon-dated SOC-depth profiles as a proxy, the past C3 and C4 plant distribution inferred from SOC δ13C conforms well to results from other paleoclimate proxies, and differences may be helpful in targeting future research. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.},

  abstract = {Several methods are used to correct total soil carbon data in response to land use or management changes inherently coupled with concomitant alteration to bulk density (BD). However, a rigorous evaluation of correction methods has not been conducted. We compared original, maximum, and minimum equivalent soil mass (ESM) corrections to the fixed depth (FD) method and direct C concentrations. In a simulation exercise of a tillage event that decreased BD without change in total C concentration to a depth of 0.3 m, the original and maximum ESM methods estimated changes in total C storage of -0.34 to 0.54 Mg C ha-1, well within the range of field soil C variability. In contrast, the minimum ESM method estimated changes ranging from -1.19 to 1.01 Mg C ha-1. In a field experiment on reduced and intensive tillage, soil C changes (0-0.18 m) were measured from May to August 2006. The maximum ESM method generally overestimated soil C changes by -0.16 to 0.60 Mg C ha-1 and the minimum ESM method underestimated them by -2.67 to 0.23 Mg C ha-1 compared to the original ESM method. Field-scale soil C changes (0-0.15 m) were also measured from August 2003 to June 2005 and decreased by an unrealistic 6.64 Mg C ha-1 over the first 6 months after tillage when the FD method was used. In contrast, the effect of tillage on soil C could be reasonably estimated by directly comparing changes in C concentration. In a compacted agricultural soil, we found more errors in simulated C differences when using the maximum than the minimum ESM method. Regardless of the direction of BD changes, the minimum ESM method was a better choice than the maximum ESM method in native and restored grassland systems where soil C concentrations decreased through the soil profile. We conclude that (1) the FD method is often not suitable and might be less accurate than direct C concentration measurements, and (2) the maximum/minimum ESM method can be accurate depending on the conditions (e.g., increasing or decreasing BD, systems conversion type), but (3) that the original ESM method is optimal for detecting soil C changes due to land use changes or management effects. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

One unsettled issue is whether the mineralization response to temperature depends on SOC mineralization rate. Long-term ({$>$}25 years) bare fallow experiments (LTBF) in which the soil is kept free of any vegetation and organic inputs, and their associated archives of soil samples represent a unique research platform to examine this issue as with increasing duration of fallow, the lability of remaining total SOC decreases. We retrieved soils from LTBF experiments situated at Askov (Denmark), Grignon (France), Ultuna (Sweden), and Versailles (France) and sampled at the start of the experiments and after 25, 50, 52, and 79 years of bare fallow, respectively. Soils were incubated at 4, 12, 20, and 35 °C and the evolved CO2 monitored. The apparent activation energy (Ea) of SOC was then calculated for similar loss of CO2 at the different temperatures. The Ea was always higher for samples taken at the end of the bare-fallow period, implying a higher temperature sensitivity of stable C than of labile C. Our results provide strong evidence for a general relationship between temperature sensitivity and SOC stability upon which significant improvements in predictive models could be based.},

Threatened by a rapidly changing world, our soils suffer from degradation and biodiversity loss, making it increasingly important to understand the role of soil biodiversity in soil aggregation—a key parameter for soil sustainability. Here, we provide evidence of the contribution of soil biota to soil aggregation on macro- and microaggregate scales, and evaluate how specific traits, soil biota groups and species interactions contribute to this. We conducted a global meta-analysis comprising 279 soil biota species. Our study shows a clear positive effect of soil biota on soil aggregation, with bacteria and fungi generally appearing to be more important for soil aggregation than soil animals. Bacteria contribute strongly to both macro- and microaggregates while fungi strongly affect macroaggregation. Motility, body size and population density were important traits modulating effect sizes. Investigating species interactions across major taxonomic groups revealed their beneficial impact on soil aggregation. At the broadest level, our results highlight the need to consider biodiversity as a causal factor in soil aggregation. This will require a shift from the current management and physicochemical perspective to an approach that fully embraces the significance of soil organisms, their diversity and interactions. The structuring of soil into distinct aggregates is a key element in biogeochemical cycling. Here, a meta-analysis reveals a strong positive effect of soil biota on soil aggregation, with the largest influence coming from bacteria and fungi.},

  abstract = {Soil organic carbon management has the potential to aid climate change mitigation through drawdown of atmospheric carbon dioxide. To be effective, such management must account for processes influencing carbon storage and re-emission at different space and time scales. Achieving this requires a conceptual advance in our understanding to link carbon dynamics from the scales at which processes occur to the scales at which decisions are made. Here, we propose that soil carbon persistence can be understood through the lens of decomposers as a result of functional complexity derived from the interplay between spatial and temporal variation of molecular diversity and composition. For example, co-location alone can determine whether a molecule is decomposed, with rapid changes in moisture leading to transport of organic matter and constraining the fitness of the microbial community, while greater molecular diversity may increase the metabolic demand of, and thus potentially limit, decomposition. This conceptual shift accounts for emergent behaviour of the microbial community and would enable soil carbon changes to be predicted without invoking recalcitrant carbon forms that have not been observed experimentally. Functional complexity as a driver of soil carbon persistence suggests soil management should be based on constant care rather than one-time action to lock away carbon in soils.},

  abstract = {Effects of agricultural land-use and land-use change on soil organic carbon (SOC) pools play an important role in the mitigation of the global greenhouse effect. To estimate these effects, baseline SOC data for individual regions or countries are needed. The aim of this study was to quantify current SOC stocks in Swiss agricultural soils, to identify meaningful predictors for SOC, and to estimate historical SOC losses. SOC stocks in mineral soils were estimated from combined georeferenced data for land-use, topography, and profile data (n=544) from soil surveys. Mean SOC density in the layer 0-20 cm ranged between 40.6±8.9 t ha-1 (±95\% confidence interval (CI)) for arable land and 50.7±12.2 t ha-1 for favourable permanent grassland, and in the layer 0-100 cm from 62.9±15.2 t ha-1 for unfavourable grassland to 117.4±29.8 t ha-1 for temporary grasslands (leys). SOC stocks in organic soils were quantified separately for intact and cultivated peatlands using data from peatland inventories and current SOC densities calculated from average peat decay rates. Organic soils account for less than 3\% of the total area but store about 28\% (47.2±7.3 Mt) of the total SOC stock of 170±17 Mt. Land-use type, clay content, and altitude (serving as a climate proxy for grassland soils at higher altitudes) were identified as main SOC predictors in mineral soils. Clay content explained up to 44\% of the variability in SOC concentrations in the fine earth of arable soils, but was not significantly related to SOC in grassland soils at higher altitudes. SOC concentration under permanent grassland increases linearly with altitude, but because soil depth and stone content limit carbon storage in alpine grassland soils, no relationship was found between altitude and SOC stock. A preliminary estimate suggested that about 16\% of the national SOC stock has been lost historically due to peatland cultivation, urbanisation, and deforestation. It seems unlikely that future changes in agricultural practices could compensate for this historical SOC loss in Swiss agricultural soils. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We hypothesized increasing amounts and declining turnover times of soil organic matter (SOM) under permanent grassland with increasing elevation and decreasing temperature. Samples from an irrigated transect in the Swiss Alps (880 to 2200 m elevation, mean annual temperatures +8.9 to +0.9°C) were analyzed. Soil C stocks ranged from 49 to 96tCha-1 (0-20 cm) and were not related to elevation, though the highest site stored least C. Particulate organic carbon (POC) increased significantly with elevation and accounted for {$>$}80\% of the total soil C at 2200 m (0-5 cm). Mean residence times (MRTs) of POC computed by means of radiocarbon dating were in the order of years to decades and were positively related to elevation in the topsoil. At higher elevations, the estimated total C flux through the soil profile mainly depended on this fraction. MRT of mineral-associated matter ranged from decades to centuries and was not systematically related to elevation, but positively related to the soil mineral surface area and it increased with soil depth. Turnover rates from simulations with the soil C model RothC exceeded those from 14 C measurements by a factor of 1.7-3.3 which suggests that C dynamics at these sites is overestimated by the model. Size of model pools and amount of C in soil fractions were only weakly correlated, thereby challenging previously postulated hypotheses concerning the correspondence of pools and fractions for grasslands at higher elevations. © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {Organic topsoil layers are important sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) transported to deeper soil layers. During passage through the mineral soil, both organic matter (OM) quality and quantity change markedly. Whether these alterations are due to sorption processes alone or to additional stepwise exchange processes of OM on mineral surfaces (“cascade model”) is not fully understood. To test the “cascade model” we conducted a laboratory flow cascade experiment with undisturbed soil columns from three depths of two different soil profiles (Dystric and Eutric Cambisol) using carbon (C) isotope labelling. Each of the connected topsoil and subsoil columns contained a goethite (α-FeOOH) layer either with or without sorbed 13C-labelled OM to assess the importance of OM immobilization/mobilization reactions with reactive soil minerals. By using a multiple method approach including 13C analysis in the solid and solution phases, nanometer scale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS), and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), we quantified organic carbon (OC) adsorption and desorption and net OC exchange at goethite surfaces as well as the associated microbial community patterns at every depth step of the column experiment. The gross OC exchange between OM-coated goethite and the soil solution was in the range of 15–32\%. This indicates that a considerable proportion of the mineral associated OM was mobilized and replaced by percolating DOM. We showed that specific groups of bacteria play an important role in processing organic carbon compounds in the mineral micro-environment. Whereas bulk soils were dominated by oligotrophic bacteria such as Acidobacteria, the goethite layers were specifically enriched with copiotrophic bacteria such as Betaproteobacteria. This group of microorganisms made use of labile carbon derived either from direct DOM transport or from OM exchange processes at goethite surfaces. Specific microorganisms appear to contribute to the cascade process of OM transport within soils. Our study confirms the validity of the postulated “cascade model” featuring the stepwise transport of OM within the soil profile.},

  abstract = {Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO\textsubscript{2}) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere \&ndash; the "global carbon budget" \&ndash; is important to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. CO\textsubscript{2} emissions from fossil fuels and industry (E\textsubscript{FF}) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, respectively, while emissions from land-use change (E\textsubscript{LUC}), mainly deforestation, are based on land-cover change data and bookkeeping models. The global atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} concentration is measured directly and its rate of growth (G\textsubscript{ATM}) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO\textsubscript{2} sink (S\textsubscript{OCEAN}) and terrestrial CO\textsubscript{2} sink (S\textsubscript{LAND}) are estimated with global process models constrained by observations. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (B\textsubscript{IM}), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of our imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ. For the last decade available (2007\&ndash;2016), E\textsubscript{FF} was 9.4\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1}, E\textsubscript{LUC} 1.3\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.7\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1}, G\textsubscript{ATM} 4.7\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.1\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1}, S\textsubscript{OCEAN} 2.4\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1}, and S\textsubscript{LAND} 3.0\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.8\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1}, with a budget imbalance B\textsubscript{IM} of 0.6\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1} indicating overestimated emissions and/or underestimated sinks. For year 2016 alone, the growth in E\textsubscript{FF} was approximately zero and emissions remained at 9.9\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1}. Also for 2016, E\textsubscript{LUC} was 1.3\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.7\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1}, G\textsubscript{ATM} was 6.1\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.2\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1}, S\textsubscript{OCEAN} was 2.6\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1} and S\textsubscript{LAND} was 2.7\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;1.0\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1}, with a small B\textsubscript{IM} of \&minus;0.3\&thinsp;GtC. G\textsubscript{ATM} continued to be higher in 2016 compared to the past decade (2007\&ndash;2016), reflecting in part the higher fossil emissions and smaller S\textsubscript{LAND} for that year consistent with El Niño conditions. The global atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} concentration reached 402.8\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.1\&thinsp;ppm averaged over 2016. For 2017, preliminary data indicate a renewed growth in E\textsubscript{FF} of +2.0\&thinsp;\% (range of 0.8\&thinsp;\% to 3.0\&thinsp;\%) based on national emissions projections for China, USA, and India, and projections of Gross Domestic Product corrected for recent changes in the carbon intensity of the economy for the rest of the world. For 2017, initial data indicate an increase in atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} concentration of around 5.3\&thinsp;GtC (2.5\&thinsp;ppm), attributed to a combination of increasing emissions and receding El Niño conditions. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new global carbon budget compared with previous publications of this data set (Le Quéré et al., 2016; 2015b; 2015a; 2014; 2013).

Such surfaces of soil aggregates and biopores are mostly covered by organic matter (OM) that finally controls wettability, sorption, and transfer properties of the flow pathways. However, the local OM properties along such surfaces are largely unknown to date because the coatings are relatively thin and vulnerable. The objective of this study was to determine and compare the local two-dimensional distribution of soil OM composition at intact aggregate surfaces that serve as preferential flow paths. The Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy in diffuse reflectance mode (diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform, DRIFT) was applied to determine transects and grids of OM functional group data (i.e., CH/CO ratios) on undisturbed and intact surfaces of soil aggregate samples using a DRIFT mapping procedure in 1-mm steps. The aggregate sample surfaces could be distinguished by DRIFT mapping in areas from earthworm burrows, root channels, and aggregate coatings. The water drop infiltration time of these structural surfaces appeared to correspond with CH/CO ratios for uncoated crack surfaces but less so for earthworm burrows. The results show that coatings at preferential flow-path surfaces differed locally in terms of OM composition, distribution, and possibly also in wettability, indicating yet unknown implications for preferential movement of water and reactive solutes.},

  abstract = {The isotopic composition of soil-derived N2O can help differentiate between N2O production pathways and estimate the fraction of N2O reduced to N2. Until now, δ18O of N2O has been rarely used in the interpretation of N2O isotopic signatures because of the rather complex oxygen isotope fractionations during N2O production by denitrification. The latter process involves nitrate reduction mediated through the following three enzymes: nitrate reductase (NAR), nitrite reductase (NIR) and nitric oxide reductase (NOR). Each step removes one oxygen atom as water (H2O), which gives rise to a branching isotope effect. Moreover, denitrification intermediates may partially or fully exchange oxygen isotopes with ambient water, which is associated with an exchange isotope effect. The main objective of this study was to decipher the mechanism of oxygen isotope fractionation during N2O production by soil denitrification and, in particular, to investigate the relationship between the extent of oxygen isotope exchange with soil water and the δ18O values of the produced N2O. In our soil incubation experiments Δ17O isotope tracing was applied for the first time to simultaneously determine the extent of oxygen isotope exchange and any associated oxygen isotope effect. We found that N2O formation in static anoxic incubation experiments was typically associated with oxygen isotope exchange close to 100 \% and a stable difference between the 18O ∕ 16O ratio of soil water and the N2O product of δ18O(N2O ∕ H2O) = (17.5 ± 1.2) ‰. However, flow-through experiments gave lower oxygen isotope exchange down to 56 \% and a higher δ18O(N2O ∕ H2O) of up to 37 ‰. The extent of isotope exchange and δ18O(N2O ∕ H2O) showed a significant correlation (R2 = 0.70, p {$<$} 0.00001). We hypothesize that this observation was due to the contribution of N2O from another production process, most probably fungal denitrification. An oxygen isotope fractionation model was used to test various scenarios with different magnitudes of branching isotope effects at different steps in the reduction process. The results suggest that during denitrification, isotope exchange occurs prior to isotope branching and that this exchange is mostly associated with the enzymatic nitrite reduction mediated by NIR. For bacterial denitrification, the branching isotope effect can be surprisingly low, about (0.0 ± 0.9) ‰, in contrast to fungal denitrification where higher values of up to 30 ‰ have been reported previously. This suggests that δ18O might be used as a tracer for differentiation between bacterial and fungal denitrification, due to their different magnitudes of branching isotope effects.},

Thirty-one articles were identified through the Web of Science and SCOPUS databases. A qualitative content analysis technique was adopted to analyze the research purposes and designs, game design and implementation, theoretical backgrounds and learning foci of these reviewed studies. The theories and models employed by these studies were classified into four theoretical foundations including cognitivism, con- structivism, the socio-cultural perspective, and enactivism. The results indicate that cognitivism and constructivism were the major theoretical foundations employed by the GBSL researchers and that the socio-cultural perspective and enactivism are two emerging theoretical paradigms that have started to draw attention from GBSL researchers in recent years. The analysis of the learning foci showed that most of the digital games were utilized to promote scientific knowledge/concept learning, while less than one- third were implemented to facilitate the students' problem- solving skills. Only a few studies explored the GBSL outcomes from the aspects of scientific processes, affect, engagement, and socio-contextual learning.

The resulting patterns of variation are complex and appear to comprise both random and deterministic components. The latter dominates vertically as trends in most soil profiles, and in the situation we describe it is prominent in the horizontal plane, too. Describing this variation requires flexible choice of covariance function. The processes of model estimation and prediction by kriging in three dimensions are similar to those in two dimensions. The extra complexity of the three-dimensional variation requires practitioners to appreciate fully the assumptions that their choices of model imply and to establish ways of testing the validity of these assumptions. We have examined several covariance functions more commonly used to describe simultaneously variation in space and time and adapted them to model three-dimensional variation in soil. We have applied these covariance functions to model the variation in salinity in reclaimed land in the Yangtze delta of China where the apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) has been measured at numerous points down to 1.1 m. The models take into account random and deterministic components in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions. The most suitable mixed model was then used to krige the ECa on a fine grid from which three-dimensional diagrams of the salinity are displayed.},

The effects of maize residue chemical composition and soil water content on soil LOC fractions and microbial properties were investigated in a laboratory incubation experiment. Maize shoot and root residues were incorporated into soil at 40\% and 70\% field capacity. The soils were incubated at 20 ??C for 150 d and destructive sampling was conducted after 15, 75, and 150 d. Respiration, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), hot-water extractable organic carbon (HEOC), and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) were recorded, along with cellulase and ??-glucosidase activities and community-level physiological profiles. The results showed that the cumulative respiration was lower in root-amended soils than in shoot-amended soils, indicating that root amendment may be beneficial to C retention in soil. No significant differences in the contents of DOC, HEOC and MBC, enzyme activities, and microbial functional diversity were observed between shoot- and root-amended soils. The high soil water content treatment significantly increased the cumulative respiration, DOC and HEOC contents, and enzyme activities compared to the low soil water content treatment. However, the soil water content treatments had little influence on the MBC content and microbial functional diversity. There were significantly positive correlations between LOC fractions and soil microbial properties. These results indicated that the chemical composition of maize residues had little influence on the DOC, HEOC, and MBC contents, enzyme activities, and microbial functional diversity, while soil water content could significantly influence DOC and HEOC contents and enzyme activities.},

However, the extent to which reactive compounds released by plants and microbes may destabilize MAOM and so enhance microbial access, as well as the underlying mechanisms, remain unclear. Here, we tested the ability of functionally distinct model exudates-ligands, reductants, and simple sugars-To promote microbial utilization of monomeric MAOM, bound via outer-sphere complexes to common iron and aluminum (hydr)oxide minerals. The strong ligand oxalic acid induced rapid MAOM mineralization, coinciding with greater sorption to and dissolution of minerals, suggestive of direct MAOM mobilization mechanisms. In contrast, the simple sugar glucose caused slower MAOM mineralization, but stimulated microbial activity and metabolite production, indicating an indirect microbially-mediated mechanism. Catechol, acting as reductant, promoted both mechanisms. While MAOM on ferrihydrite showed the greatest vulnerability to both direct and indirect mechanisms, MAOM on other (hydr)oxides was more susceptible to direct mechanisms. These findings suggest that MAOM persistence, and thus longterm carbon storage within a given soil, is not just a function of mineral reactivity but also depends on the capacity of plant roots and associated microbes to produce reactive compounds capable of triggering specific destabilization mechanisms.},

  abstract = {High-quality plant inputs to the soil with low lignin to nitrogen ratios have been conceptualized to foster the formation of soil organic matter (SOM) and carbon (C) in stabilized soil compartments, such as aggregates and organo-mineral associations (MAOM), in dependence of the soil's capacity to store additional C (i.e., C saturation deficit). Yet, evidence for these conceptualizations from field experiments is scarce and it is unclear whether factors commonly not included in laboratory experiments (such as soil depth) may modulate the influence of substrate quality on SOM formation. We, thus, tested the effect of substrates with different qualities (from European alder and Scots pine) on C stocks in bulk soil, free particulate and aggregate-occluded organic matter, and MAOM in soils at various ages after reclamation and at different soil depths in a common-garden field experiment. Our results revealed that substrate quality generally acted in the predicted way in the upper investigated soil layer (0–5 cm depth), i.e., high-quality substrates increased C stocks in MAOM. Surprisingly, the effect of substrate quality reversed with depth (5–15 cm; i.e., low-quality litters were associated with higher C stocks in MAOM), potentially due to a higher sensitivity (or “priming”) of native SOM in response to high-quality substrates at depth or a lower probability of such substrates reaching deeper soil layers. These patterns appeared to be largely independent of the soils' theoretical capacity to stabilize additional C, which was exceeded in all investigated soils. Based on the results of our field experiment, we highlight the need to refine recent conceptualizations by focusing on environmental factors that are commonly not accounted for in laboratory-scale experiments and that may alter the direction in which substrate quality acts to influence the formation of SOM.},

  abstract = {Studies of the decomposition, transformation and stabilization of soil organic matter (SOM) have dramatically increased in recent years owing to growing interest in studying the global carbon (C) cycle as it pertains to climate change. While it is readily accepted that the magnitude of the organic C reservoir in soils depends upon microbial involvement, as soil C dynamics are ultimately the consequence of microbial growth and activity, it remains largely unknown how these microorganism-mediated processes lead to soil C stabilization. Here, we define two pathways-ex vivo modification and in vivo turnover-which jointly explain soil C dynamics driven by microbial catabolism and/or anabolism. Accordingly, we use the conceptual framework of the soil 'microbial carbon pump' (MCP) to demonstrate how microorganisms are an active player in soil C storage. The MCP couples microbial production of a set of organic compounds to their further stabilization, which we define as the entombing effect. This integration captures the cumulative long-Term legacy of microbial assimilation on SOM formation, with mechanisms (whether via physical protection or a lack of activation energy due to chemical composition) that ultimately enable the entombment of microbial-derived C in soils. We propose a need for increased efforts and seek to inspire new studies that utilize the soil MCP as a conceptual guideline for improving mechanistic understandings of the contributions of soil C dynamics to the responses of the terrestrial C cycle under global change.},

Even though our understanding of the nature of soil organic matter has recently been substantially revised, fundamental uncertainty remains about the quantitative importance of microbial necromass as part of persistent organic mat‐ ter. Addressing this uncertainty has been hampered by the absence of quantitative assessments whether microbial matter makes up the majority of the persistent carbon in soil. Direct quantitation of microbial necromass in soil is very challenging because of an overlapping molecular signature with nonmicrobial organic carbon. Here, we use a comprehensive analysis of existing biomarker amino sugar data published between 1996 and 2018, combined with novel appropriation using an ecological systems approach, elemental carbon–nitrogen stoichiometry, and biomarker scal‐ ing, to demonstrate a suit of strategies for quantitating the contribution of microbe‐ derived carbon to the topsoil organic carbon reservoir in global temperate agricultural, grassland, and forest ecosystems. We show that microbial necromass can make up more than half of soil organic carbon. Hence, we suggest that next‐generation field management requires promoting microbial biomass formation and necromass preservation to maintain healthy soils, ecosystems, and climate. Our analyses have important implications for improving current climate and carbon models, and helping develop management practices and policies.},

This study addresses the fate of litter-derived carbon (C) in whole soil profiles with regard to the conceptual cascade model, which proposes that OM formation in subsoils is linked to sorption-microbial processing-remobilization cycles during the downward migration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Our main objectives were to quantify the contribution of recent litter to subsoil C stocks via DOC translocation and to evaluate the stability of litter-derived OM in different functional OM fractions.{$<$}/p{$>$} A plot-scale stable isotope-labeling experiment was conducted in a temperate beech forest by replacing the natural litter layer with 13C enriched litter on an area of 20m2 above a Dystric Cambisol. After 22 months of field exposure, the labeled litter was replaced again by natural litter and soil cores were drilled down to 180cm soil depth. Water extraction and density fractionation were combined with stable isotope measurements in order to link the fluxes of recent litter-derived C to its allocation into different functional OM fractions. A second sampling was conducted 18 months later to further account for the stability of translocated young litter-derived C.{$<$}/p{$>$} Almost no litter-derived particulate OM (POM) entered the subsoil, suggesting root biomass as the major source of subsoil POM. The contribution of aboveground litter to the formation of mineral-associated OM (MAOM) in topsoils (0-10cm) was 1.88±0.83gCm-2 and decreased to 0.69±0.19gCm-2 in the upper subsoil (10-50cm) and 0.01±0.02gCm-2 in the deep subsoil {$>$}100cm soil depth during the 22 months. This finding suggests a subordinate importance of recent litter layer inputs via DOC translocation to subsoil C stocks, and implies that most of the OM in the subsoil is of older age. Smaller losses of litter-derived C within MAOM of about 66\% compared to POM (77\%-89\%) over 18 months indicate that recent carbon can be stabilized by interaction with mineral surfaces; although the overall stabilization in the sandy study soils is limited. Our isotope-labeling approach supports the concept of OM undergoing a sequence of cycles of sorption, microbial processing, and desorption while migrating down a soil profile, which needs to be considered in models of soil OM formation and subsoil C cycling.},

Particularly, subsoils are considered to have a high potential for additional C storage due to mineral surfaces still available for sorptive stabilization. Aims: Little information exists about the extent to which additional litter-derived C is transferred to and stabilized in subsoils. This study aimed at evaluating the role of litter-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) inputs for the formation of stable mineral-associated C in subsoils. Methods: We carried out a multiple-method approach including field labeling with 13C-enriched litter, exposure of 13C-loaded reactive minerals to top- and subsoils, and laboratory sorption experiments. Results: For temperate forest soils, we found that the laboratory-based C sink capacity of subsoils is unlikely to be reached under field conditions. Surface C inputs via litter leachates are little conducive to the subsoil C pool. Only 0.5\% of litter-derived C entered the subsoil as DOM within nearly 2 years and most of the recently sorbed C is prone to fast microbial mineralization rather than long-term mineral retention. Desorption to the soil solution and an adapted microbial community re-mobilize organic matter in subsoils faster than considered so far. Conclusions: We conclude that the factors controlling the current mineral retention and stabilization of C within temperate forest subsoils will likewise limit additional C uptake. Thus, in contrast to their widely debated potential to accrue more C, the role of forest subsoils as future C sink is likely overestimated and needs further reconsideration.},

They were described, characterised and samples were taken from each of the main horizons. Material not used for analysis was stored in the National Soils Archive. Between 2007 and 2009, 183 of these locations were re-visited (20 km intervals) and fresh samples taken to identify changes in nutrient status, pH and, in particular, soil carbon concentrations and stocks over the 19-31 year period. The archived soil samples from this time were re-analysed alongside those from the recent sampling to determine carbon concentrations. Near Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy was used to estimate their bulk density so that carbon stocks could be calculated as this was not measured at the original sampling. The results showed no statistically significant change in soil carbon stocks to 1 m depth for the main, broad land use types in Scotland apart from a small but significant increase (P=0.035) in soils under woodland. There was approximately 11.5\% difference in carbon concentration between the reanalysed, archived soil and values originally obtained, but this was attributed to an artefact of differences in analytical methods. Between the two sampling periods, a decrease in carbon concentration of 2.4 g kg-1 was detected in cultivated soils. However, a significant increase in topsoil thickness of 2.9 cm (P=0.024) was sufficient to compensate for these changes in arable soils such that there was no detectable change in carbon stocks. The work shows the value of soil archives and of measuring horizon thickness.},

It was hypothesized that SPMs and SNRs would effectively separate stands with distinctive climate, site, and soil characteristics and forest floor and soil carbon and nitrogen reserves. At 60 Douglas-fir stands, SPMs and SNRs were determined, and soil particle percentages, soil depth, and forest floor and soil nitrogen and carbon contents were measured to a depth of 1 m. Soils of sedimentary origin and very rich and rich SNRs contained greater nitrogen and carbon contents than those from glacial and igneous origins and medium SNRs. Sedimentary SPMs and very rich SNRs were developed from older parent materials and had significantly greater soil depths and finer textures than those from glacial SPMs and medium SNRs. SNRs and SPMs are recommended as good estimators of soil nutrient pools and soil characteristics in Douglas-fir plantation forests of the Pacific Northwest.},

Although soil respiration was not altered by N addition, dissolved organic carbon concentration was increased by 18\%, suggesting C leaching loss may increase.

  abstract = {There is a serious lack of detailed and accurate three-dimensional soil distribution information worldwide. This study examined the effectiveness of combining radial basis function (RBF) neural networks and profile depth functions to map the three-dimensional distribution of soil organic matter (SOM) in a subtropical hilly landscape in southern Anhui Province, China. The RBF networks were used to predict the lateral distribution of SOM based on its relations with terrain attributes and land uses, while the depth functions were used to fit its vertical distribution based on sparse measurements of SOM in soil genetic horizons. Compared with power and logarithmic functions, the equal-area quadratic splines had smaller bias, higher accuracy, and more stable performance in fitting the vertical SOM distribution. The prediction accuracy of the whole three-dimensional mapping method decreased with depth within the upper 60 cm, while the best accuracy occurred below 60 cm. In the upper 30 cm, areas with high elevation tended to have high predicted SOM content and vice versa. There were local deviations from this pattern in areas where toeslopes and ravines had higher predicted SOM content than backslopes, even though the latter are at higher elevations. Multiple regressions with dummy variables showed that the influence of terrain conditions on SOM content was strong in the upper 60 cm and weak below 60 cm, while that of land use was strong in the upper 30 cm and weak below 30 cm. Both influences were the strongest in the upper 15-cm soil layer. Under the same terrain conditions, agricultural cultivation is associated with SOM accumulation in the upper 30 cm.},

  abstract = {Organic matter input to soils can accelerate the decomposition of native soil carbon (C), a process called the priming effect. Priming is ubiquitous and exhibits some consistent patterns, but a general explanation remains elusive, in part because of variation in the response across different ecosystems, and because of a diversity of proposed mechanisms, including microbial activation, stoichiometry, and community shifts. Here, we conducted five-week incubations of four soils (grassland, piñon-juniper, ponderosa pine, mixed conifer), varying the amount of substrate added (as 13C-glucose, either 350 or 1000 μg C g−1 week−1) and either with no added nitrogen (N), or with sufficient N (as NH4NO3) to bring the C-to-N ratio of the added substrate to 10. Using four different ecosystems enabled testing the generality of mechanisms underlying the priming effect. The responses of priming to the amount and C-to-N ratio of the added substrate were consistent across ecosystems: priming increased with the rate of substrate addition and declined when the C-to-N ratio of the substrate was reduced. However, structural equation models failed to confirm intermediate responses postulated to mediate the priming effect, including responses postulated to be mediated by stoichiometry and microbial activation. Specifically, priming was not clearly associated with changes in microbial biomass or turnover, nor with extracellular enzyme activities or the microbial C-to-N ratio. The strongest explanatory pathways in the structural equation models were the substrate, soil, and C-to-N ratio treatments themselves, with no intermediates, suggesting that either these measurements lacked sufficient sensitivity to reveal causal relationships, or the actual drivers for priming were not included in the ancillary measurements. While we observed consistent changes in priming caused by the amount and C-to-N ratio of the added substrate across a wide array of soils, our findings did not clearly conform to common models offered for the priming effect. Because priming is a residual flux involving diverse substrates of varying chemical composition, a simple and generalizable explanation of the phenomenon may be elusive.},

  abstract = {The decomposition of soil organic matter depends strongly on its availability to microorganisms and their enzymes. The rhizosphere and detritusphere are microbial hot spots due to additional substrate input, leading to high abundance, specific species diversity and functional diversity of microbial communities. However, rhizosphere and detritusphere differ in substrate quality, localization, and duration of input. We hypothesized that the contrasting substrate availability between rhizosphere and detritusphere affects the activity of microorganisms and associated enzymes. Organic carbon (C) from the rhizosphere and detritusphere decreases with soil depth and, consequently, microbial hot spots become rarer and competition for C and nutrients increases. In deeper soil ({$>$}40 cm depth) the amount and quality of substrates is expected to decrease and, therefore, the effect of contrasting substrate input to disappear. Plant N uptake is expected to reduce N availability in the rhizosphere of maize compared to the detritusphere and bare fallow. These hypotheses were tested in a factorial field experiment with 1) maize-planted, 2) maize litter-amended, and 3) bare sites. Enzyme kinetic parameters (Vmax, Km, Ka), extractable organic C and microbial biomass C were compared in soil affected by rhizosphere and detritusphere throughout the profile to 70 cm depth, to assess microbial C and nutrient limitations. A decrease in enzyme activity with depth due to resource scarcity and lower substrate quality appeared in planted and litter-amended soil. N limitation in planted soil increased the activity and substrate affinity of proteolytic enzymes to provide for microbial N demand through SOM decomposition. This was in line with lower Vmaxratios (Vmaxfor C-cycling enzymes divided by Vmaxfor N-cycling enzymes) in planted relative to litter-amended topsoil. The catalytic efficiency of enzymes decreased 2- to 20-fold from top- ({$<$}40 cm) to subsoil ({$>$}40 cm), irrespective of the substrate input. Substrate quality in the rhizosphere and detritusphere affected enzyme activities only in the topsoil, whereas a sharp decline of C input with depth led to similar activities in the subsoil. Most of the enzyme indexes reflected shifts in allocation of C and nutrients in the rhizosphere and detritusphere. The presented results underline the role of microorganisms as critical links in the C and nutrient transfers in the rhizosphere and detritusphere.},

At two levels of mineral nitrogen supply, N-(150 kgN ha-1 y-1) and N+(533 kgN ha-1 y-1), 15N-labelled ammonium nitrate was supplied in split applications over a 2.5-y period. The recovery of the labelled fertilizer N was measured in the harvests, in the stubble and roots, in the macro-organic matter fractions above 200 μm in size (MOM) and in the aggregated organic matter below 200 μmM (AOM). Elevated [CO2] reduced the total amount of N harvested in the clipped parts of the sward. The harvested N derived from soil was reduced to a greater extent than that derived from fertilizer. At both N supplies, elevated [CO2] modified the allocation of the fertilizer N in the sward, in favour of the stubble and roots and significantly increased the recovery of fertilizer N in the soil macro-organic matter fractions. The increase of fertilizer N immobilization in the MOM was associated with a decline of fertilizer N uptake by the grass sward, which supported the hypothesis of a negative feedback of elevated [CO2] on the sward N yield and uptake. Similar and even more pronounced effects were observed for the native N mineralized in the soil. At N-, a greater part of the fertilizer N organized in the root phytomass resulted in an underestimation of N immobilized in dead roots and, in turn, an underestimation of N immobilization in the MOM. The 3°C temperature increase alleviated the [CO2] effect throughout much of the N cycle, increasing soil N mineralization, N derived from soil in the harvests, and the partitioning of the assimilated fertilizer N to shoots. In conclusion, at ambient temperature, the N cycle was slowed down under elevated [CO2], which restricted the increase in the aboveground production of the grass sward, and apparently contributed to the sequestration of carbon belowground. In contrast, a temperature increase under elevated [CO2] stimulated the soil nitrogen cycle, improved the N nutrition of the sward and restricted the magnitude of the soil C sequestration.},

We used complete and comprehensive county-level yields and area data to estimate and analyze the spatial and temporal variability of regional and national scale residue C inputs, net primary productivity (NPP), and C stocks in US croplands from 1982 to 1997. Annual residue C inputs were highest in the North Central and Central and Northern Plains regions that comprise similar to 70\% of US cropland. Average residue C inputs ranged from 1.8 (Delta States) to 3.0 (North Central region) Mg C ha(-1) year(-1), and average NPP ranged from 3.1 (Delta States) to 5.4 (Far West region) Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). Residue C inputs tended to be inversely proportional to the mean growing season temperature. A quadratic relationship incorporating the growing season mean temperature and total precipitation closely predicted the variation in residue C inputs in the North Central region and Central and Northern Plains. We analyzed the soil C balance using the crop residue database and the Introductory Carbon Balance regional Model (ICBMr). Soil C stocks (0-20 cm) on permanent cropland ranged between 3.07 and 3.1 Pg during the study period, with an average increase of similar to 4 Tg C year(-1), during the 1990s. Interannual variability in soil C stocks ranged from 0 to 20 Tg C (across a mean C stock of 3.08 +/- A 0.01 Pg) during the study period; interannual variability in residue C inputs varied between 1 and 43 Tg C (across a mean input of 220 +/- A 19 Tg). Such interannual variation has implications for national estimates of CO(2) emissions from cropland soils needed for implementation of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation strategies involving agriculture.},

What has emerged from a series of recent DNA sequencing-based studies is recognition of the enormous variety of little known and previously unknown microorganisms that mediate recycling of these vast stores of buried carbon in subsoil compartments of the terrestrial system. More importantly, the genome resolution achieved in these studies has enabled association of specific members of these microbial communities with carbon compound transformations and other linked biogeochemical processes???such as the nitrogen cycle???that can impact the quality of groundwater, surface water, and atmospheric trace gas concentrations. The emerging view also emphasizes the importance of organism interactions through exchange of metabolic byproducts (e.g., within the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles) and via symbioses since many novel organisms exhibit restricted metabolic capabilities and an associated extremely small cell size. New, genome-resolved information reshapes our view of subsurface microbial communities and provides critical new inputs for advanced reactive transport models. These inputs are needed for accurate prediction of feedbacks in watershed biogeochemical functioning and their influence on the climate via the fluxes of greenhouse gases, CO2, CH4, and N2O.},

  abstract = {Long-term stabilisation of soil organic matter (SOM) largely depends on its interaction with the active mineral components of soils. SOM may become associated with the mineral active surfaces through a wide variety of linkages, with different strength. Thus, fractionation procedures capable of assessing the strength through which mineral-associated SOM is stabilised can be very useful. This paper presents a soil organo-mineral fractionation method (henceforth, SOF) that essentially resumes the work of classical pedologists, who aimed to quantify the different modes through which organic compounds are bound to the mineral matrix using sequential extractions with chemical reagents (0.1 M sodium tetraborate, 0.1 M sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 M sodium hydroxide, 0.1 M sodium hydroxide after sodium dithionite pretreatment, and 0.1 M sodium hydroxide after hydrofluoric acid pretreatment). We added a previous extraction with 0.5 M potassium sulfate to remove soluble organic compounds, and a weak acid attack with 0.33 M sulfuric acid to destroy possible SOM-occluding carbonate films, which are often assumed to contribute to SOM stability in calcareous soils. The proposed sequence is applied only to the organo-mineral complexes ({$<$}20 μm), after the removal of the particulate organic matter (POM) by ultrasonic dispersion and wet sieving.We tested the SOF method on four contrasting soils: two Haplic Calcisols (under crop and forest) and two Humic Cambisols (under forest and pasture), with organic C (OC) contents ranging from 1.8 to 3.4\% and pH from 3.9 to 8.0. Our results showed that the mineral-associated SOM represents the largest SOM fraction (67-72\% of the total organic C content), and that a substantial part of it is weakly associated with the mineral matrix, as it can be extracted by sodium tetraborate or sodium pyrophosphate. While the sodium tetraborate extract was the main fraction in acid soils, the sodium pyrophosphate extract was the main fraction in calcareous soils, thus highlighting the role of Ca in SOM stability. In contrast, our results suggest a small role of carbonate precipitation in the stabilisation of SOM {$<$} 20 μm. The sodium hydroxide extractions after both the sodium dithionite and HF treatments released little SOM in the studied soils, but the remaining (insoluble) residue accounted for 15-30\% of total OC, and deserves further study. The SOF method can be a valuable tool for splitting mineral-associated SOM into different fractions regarding their proneness for extraction, and its thoroughness may prove most useful for comparative studies about SOM stabilisation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

After an extended dry period, a pulse of soil CO2 release is commonly observed upon rewetting (the so-called ‘Birch effect'), the magnitude of which depends on soil rewetting frequency. But the source and implications of this CO2 efflux are unclear. We used a mesocosm field experiment to subject agricultural topsoil to two distinct drying and rewetting frequencies, measuring Birch effects (as 3-day cumulative CO2 efflux upon rewetting) and the overall CO2 efflux over the entire drying-rewetting cycle. We used 14C-labelled wheat straw to determine the contribution of fresh (recently incorporated) plant litter or extant soil organic matter (SOM) to these fluxes, and assessed the extent to which the amount of soil microbial biomass + K2SO4-extractable organic C (fumigated-extracted C, FEC) before rewetting determined the magnitude of Birch effect CO2 pulses. Our results showed a gradual increase in SOM-derived organic solutes within the FEC fraction, and a decrease in soil microbial biomass, under more extreme drying and rewetting conditions. But, contrary to our hypothesis, pre-wetting levels of FEC were not related to the magnitude of the Birch effects. In the longer term, rewetting frequency and temperature influenced the overall (31-day cumulative) amount of CO2–C released from SOM upon rewetting, but the overall 14CO2–C respired from fresh straw was only influenced by the rewetting frequency, with no effect of seasonal temperature differences of ∼15 °C. We conclude that the mineralization of fresh plant litter in soils is more sensitive to water limitations than extant SOM in soils under drying-rewetting conditions. Moreover, we found little evidence to support the hypothesis that the availability of microbial and soluble organic C before rewetting determined the magnitude of the Birch effects, and suggest that future work should investigate whether these short-term CO2 pulses are predominantly derived from substrate-supply mechanisms resulting from the disruption of the soil organo-mineral matrix.},

Deeper soil horizons, however, may have a high capacity to sequester significant amounts of SOC as the turnover time and chemical recalcitrance of soil organic matter (SOM) increases with depth. The subsoil carbon (C) sequestration may be achieved by higher inputs of fairly stable organic matter to deeper soil horizons. This can be achieved directly by selecting plants/cultivars with deeper and thicker root systems that are high in chemical recalcitrant compounds like suberin. Furthermore, recalcitrant compounds could be a target for plant breeding/biotechnology to promote C sequestration. A high surface input of organic matter favors the production of dissolved organic carbon that can be transported to deeper soil horizons and thus contribute to the subsoil C storage. By promoting the activity of the soil fauna, organic matter can be transferred to deeper soil layers and stabilized (e.g., in earthworm casts). Manipulating the subsoil microorganisms may result in higher amounts of fairly stable aliphatic compounds. The subsoil below 1-m depth may have the potential to sequester between 760 and 1520 Pg C. These estimates are, however, highly uncertain and more studies on C storage in subsoil horizons and the assessment of the chemical nature of subsoil organic C are needed. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The weighting schemes incrementally reduce uncertainty to a minimum value of 125 Pg C in 2100, but this reduction requires an impractical observational constraint. We suggest that a focus on reducing multi- model spread may not make terrestrial carbon cycle projections more reliable, and instead advocate for accurate observations, improved process understanding, and a multitude of modeling approaches.},

This parameter has different variants in literatures, including a commonly used turnover time. However, neither of them has been carefully examined under transient C dynamics in response to climate change. In this study, we estimated both C turnover time as defined by the conventional stock-over-flux (i.e., Olson method) and mean C transit time as defined by the mean age of C mass leaving the system (i.e., Rasmussen method). We incorporated them into Community Atmosphere-Biosphere-Land Exchange model (CABLE) to estimate C turnover time and transit time, respectively, in response to climate warming and rising atmospheric [CO\textsubscript{2}]. Modeling analysis showed that both C turnover time and transit time increased with climate warming but decreased with rising atmospheric [CO\textsubscript{2}]. The increase of C turnover time with warming was estimated to be 2.4 years with Olson method whereas the transit time increased by 11.8 years with Rasmussen method. The decrease with rising atmospheric [CO\textsubscript{2}] was estimated to be 3.8 years with Olson method and 5.5 years with Rasmussen method. Our analysis based on Rasmussen method showed that 65\% of the increase in global mean C transit time with climate warming results from the depletion of fast-turnover C pool. The remaining 35\% increase results from accompanied changes in compartment C age structures. Similarly, the decrease in mean C transit time with rising atmospheric [CO\textsubscript{2}] results approximately equally from replenishment of C into fast-turnover C pool and subsequent decrease in compartment C age structure. Greatly different from the Rasmussen method, the Olsen method, which does not account for changes in either C age structure or composition of respired C, underestimated impacts of either warming or rising atmospheric [CO\textsubscript{2}] on C diagnostic time and potentially lead to biases in estimating land C sequestration.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

To predict long-term ecosystem C storage, it is essential to examine whether soil N becomes progressively limiting as C and N are sequestered in long-lived plant biomass and soil organic matter. A critical parameter to indicate the long-term progressive N limitation (PNL) is net change in ecosystem N content in association with C accumulation in plant and soil pools under elevated CO2. We compiled data from 104 published papers that study C and N dynamics at ambient and elevated CO2. The compiled database contains C contents, N contents, and C:N ratio in various plant and soil pools, and root:shoot ratio. Averaged C and N pool sizes in plant and soil all significantly increase at elevated CO2 in comparison to those at ambient CO2, ranging from a 5\% increase in shoot N content to a 32\% increase in root C content. The C and N contents in litter pools are consistently higher in elevated than ambient CO2 among all the surveyed studies whereas C and N contents in the other pools increase in some studies and decrease in other studies. The high variability in CO2-induced changes in C and N pool sizes results from diverse responses of various C and N processes to elevated CO2. Averaged C:N ratios are higher by 3\% in litter and soil pools and 11\% in root and shoot pools at elevated relative to ambient CO2. Elevated CO2 slightly increases root:shoot ratio. The net N accumulation in plant and soil pools at least helps prevent complete down-regulation of, and likely supports, long-term CO2 stimulation of C sequestration. The concomitant C and N accumulations in response to rising atmospheric CO2 may reflect intrinsic nature of ecosystem development as revealed before by studies of succession over hundreds to millions of years.},

  abstract = {Despite its relevance to long term carbon sequestration in soils, there is to date no successful experimental way to isolate all the stable pool of soil organic carbon (SOC), i.e. SOC that has a residence time of centuries to millennia. Long term bare fallows (LTBF) offer a unique opportunity to study stable SOC, as without carbon inputs and with continuing biodegradation and mineralization, SOC becomes progressively enriched in its most stable components. Here, we took advantage of the 42 plots LTBF experiment of Versailles (France), where C inputs stopped 80 years ago, to test the relevance of chemical oxidation methods to isolate a pool of carbon stable at the centennial timescale. To do so, we studied the effect of two oxidizing reagents -hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, and sodium hypochlorite, NaOCl on soil total organic carbon (TOC) content after 0 and 79 years of LTBF. If these methods can isolate centennial stable C, then chemical oxidation resistant-C from 0 and 79 years of LTBF should equate, in amount, with TOC after 79 years of LTBF. Results showed that chemical oxidation strongly decreased TOC in both soils. Oxidation-resistant OC accounted for ca.1 mgC g-1 soil, which is five times smaller than TOC in the untreated LTBF79 soils, after 79 years of biological oxidation. Moreover, the amount of oxidation-resistant OC was significantly lower in LTBF79 compared to LTBF0. We conclude that neither centennial stable carbon nor older stable carbon can be successfully quantified by these chemical oxidation methods. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

  abstract = {Mechanisms for C stabilization in soils have received much interest recently due to their relevance in the global C cycle. Here we review the mechanisms that are currently, but often contradictorily or inconsistently, considered to contribute to organic matter (OM) protection against decomposition in temperate soils: (i) selective preservation due to recalcitrance of OM, including plant litter, rhizodeposits, microbial products, humic polymers, and charred OM; (ii) spatial inaccessibility of OM against decomposer organisms due to occlusion, intercalation, hydrophobicity and encapsulation; and (iii) stabilization by interaction with mineral surfaces (Fe-, Al-, Mn-oxides, phyllosilicates) and metal ions. Our goal is to assess the relevance of these mechanisms to the formation of soil OM during different stages of decomposition and under different soil conditions. The view that OM stabilization is dominated by the selective preservation of recalcitrant organic components that accumulate in proportion to their chemical properties can no longer be accepted. In contrast, our analysis of mechanisms shows that: (i) the soil biotic community is able to disintegrate any OM of natural origin; (ii) molecular recalcitrance of OM is relative, rather than absolute; (iii) recalcitrance is only important during early decomposition and in active surface soils; while (iv) during late decomposition and in the subsoil, the relevance of spatial inaccessibility and organo-mineral interactions for SOM stabilization increases. We conclude that major difficulties in the understanding and prediction of SOM dynamics originate from the simultaneous operation of several mechanisms. We discuss knowledge gaps and promising directions of future research.},

Here, we identified climate and topographic controls on soil organic carbon storage along the Catalina Critical Zone Observatory that spans a significant range in mean annual temperature ( {$>$} 10 °C) and mean annual precipitation ( {$>$} 50 cm year −1 ). Granitic soils were collected from divergent summit and convergent footslope positions in desert scrub, pine, and mixed conifer systems. Physical soil carbon distribution was quantified using a density and sonication technique to obtain the “free,” “occluded,” and heavy “mineral” soil carbon pools. We examined bulk soil ( {$<$} 2 mm) and density fractions using total carbon (\%), stable isotopic composition (δ 13 C), and radiocarbon analyses (Δ 14 C). Desert scrub soils stored minimal soil carbon ( {$<$} 1\% by weight) that was partitioned to the heavy mineral pool. Surprisingly, we identified depleted ∆ 14 C in the bulk soil (−9 to −66‰) and mineral C fractions (−72 to −90‰) from subsurface weathered granite in the desert system. The transition to the productive P. pine ecosystem was met with more soil C ( {$>$} 3\%) that partitioned evenly between the free light and mineral fractions. Soil C in the P. pine system also reflected the impact of a moderate severity fire in 2002 that led to modern ∆ 14 C values for bulk soil and density fractions. The mixed conifer system contained a greater proportion of passive occluded C in the subsurface soils. We observed evidence for modern fire inputs into the surface soils of the mixed conifer system in combination with buried charcoal and occluded C associated with historic fire events. Convergent landscapes contained higher soil carbon stocks and depleted ∆ 14 C relative to adjacent divergent landscapes, suggesting a landscape-level mechanism that includes the transport, burial, and preservation of soil carbon downslope. These data sets provide insights into ecosystem- and hillslope-scale variations in soil carbon storage across semiarid to subhumid environments.},

  abstract = {To improve the understanding of nutrient cycling in soil there is a need for development of methods to quantify biologically-meaningful fractions of soil organic matter which turn over in the short or medium-term. Homogeneously 14C-labelled shoots from ryegrass grown at ambient (350 μl l-1) and elevated (700 μl l-1) CO2 concentrations were added to a loamy sand and incubated for up to 200 days. Three size-density methods were tested in order to elucidate the breakdown of the plant material. One approach involved density separation in Ludox TM40 (a colloidal silica suspension) but only included soil materials {$>$}150 μm. The other two approaches in which sodium polytungstate was used as density agent included all solid and soluble soil material. One of these involved a size separation (at 100 μm) prior to density separation, while the other was performed on whole soil. Density fractionation in a centrifuge (10,000 g) without initial size-separation substantially reduced the recovery of freshly-added plant material in the light fraction. We assume that this was partly due to the loss of air entrapped in intact tissue during centrifugation, and partly due to interactions between small heavy particles and the large light plant material. Fractionation by size and density thus seems a more powerful approach for separating soil organic matter fractions than fractionation based on density alone. Separation of finer textured materials ({$<$}100 μm) by density resulted in fractions with similar specific activity, indicating that they did not differ greatly in their turnover rates. The changes with time in the specific activity of the fine fractions indicated that they acted as sinks for microbial products, and only contributed slightly to the mineralization of the freshly-added C. The soluble carbon was consistently the most 14C-enriched fraction and contained a substantial amount of 14C throughout the incubation. The large, light fractions consisted of identifiable plant residues and were enriched in 14C during the 200 day incubation. Subdivision of the large fraction by density resulted in fractions with considerably different initial enrichment, presumably due to greater airfilled porosity in less decomposed or frayed materials. Losses of "native" soil carbon were small, compared with the analytical uncertainties, and thus the identification of active "native" soil fractions was hampered. Differences in the decomposition patterns between ryegrass grown at ambient and elevated CO2 concentrations, measured by CO2 respiration after 10 days, were observed with the large ({$>$}150 μm) light Ludox fractions. At the end of the experiment no differences between plant material grown at ambient and elevated CO2 concentrations were detected in earlier CO2 evolution or in the different soil organic matter fractions. Mineralization of C from previously leached plant materials was considerably enhanced by exposure to Ludox and retarded by exposure to sodium polytungstate. Copyright © 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Aqueous compositions, fluid chemistry, transport, and mineral abundances are well characterized [White A. F., Schulz M. S., Vivit D. V., Blum A., Stonestrom D. A. and Anderson S. P.

I: interpreting the long-term controls on chemical weathering based on spatial and temporal element and mineral distributions. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 72 (1), 36-68] and were used to constrain the reaction rates for the weathering and precipitating minerals in the reactive transport modeling. When primary mineral weathering rates are calculated with either of two experimentally determined rate constants, the nonlinear, parallel rate law formulation of Hellmann and Tisserand [Hellmann R. and Tisserand D. (2006) Dissolution kinetics as a function of the Gibbs free energy of reaction: An experimental study based on albite feldspar. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 70 (2), 364-383] or the aluminum inhibition model proposed by Oelkers et al. [Oelkers E. H., Schott J. and Devidal J. L. (1994) The effect of aluminum, pH, and chemical affinity on the rates of aluminosilicate dissolution reactions. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 58 (9), 2011-2024], modeling results are consistent with field-scale observations when independently constrained clay precipitation rates are accounted for. Experimental and field rates, therefore, can be reconciled at the Santa Cruz site. Additionally, observed maximum clay abundances in the argillic horizons occur at the depth and time where the reaction fronts of the primary minerals overlap. The modeling indicates that the argillic horizon at Santa Cruz can be explained almost entirely by weathering of primary minerals and in situ clay precipitation accompanied by undersaturation of kaolinite at the top of the profile. The rate constant for kaolinite precipitation was also determined based on model simulations of mineral abundances and dissolved Al, SiO 2 (aq) and pH in pore waters. Changes in the rate of kaolinite precipitation or the flow rate do not affect the gradient of the primary mineral weathering profiles, but instead control the rate of propagation of the primary mineral weathering fronts and thus total mass removed from the weathering profile. Our analysis suggests that secondary clay precipitation is as important as aqueous transport in governing the amount of dissolution that occurs within a profile because clay minerals exert a strong control over the reaction affinity of the dissolving primary minerals. The modeling also indicates that the weathering advance rate and the total mass of mineral dissolved is controlled by the thermodynamic saturation of the primary dissolving phases plagioclase and K-feldspar, as is evident from the difference in propagation rates of the reaction fronts for the two minerals despite their very similar kinetic rate laws. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

Cosmogenic isotopes, formed in situ within the Earth's surface or in the atmosphere (“meteoric”) are important chronometers for both time and fluxes. Meteoric 10Be has been used to evaluate surface ages, soil residence times and rates of sediment transport; however, the meteoric 10Be dating tool relies on complete retention of 10Be on mineral surfaces within the weathered regolith, an assumption that will not be valid where soil pH is low or mineral surface area available for sorption is lacking. Here we evaluate whether the stable isotope of 9Be that is released upon weathering (“reactive” Be) can be used to correct for 10Be mobility. This approach relies on the inventory of reactive 9Be in the weathering zone as a measure of the mass depletion, whereas the 10Be inventory is a function of age. To explore the spatial and temporal relationship between the Be isotopes, we use a multi-component reactive transport model framework to evaluate a set of differential mass balance equations for the 10Be/9Be composition of the bulk solid and sorbed reservoirs on non-eroding surfaces. We first find that the (10Be/9Be)reac is inversely proportional to the long-term chemical weathering rate, even in cases of incomplete Be retention. Second, we find that coupling 10Be and 9Be to provide a tool for surface age dating (10Be) is complex because incomplete retention affects each isotope to a different extent. Beryllium-10 is supplied at the surface of soil, where sorption onto secondary minerals is more extensive, while 9Be is released from primary minerals at the weathering front where secondary minerals are less abundant. If 9Be loss is less than about 15\%, we find 9Be inventories can be used to reliably correct 10Be inventories to within 10\%. The error associated with the correction also increases with increasing age, and thus the correction is more favorable for younger surfaces. Over longer timescales, the error on the age introduced by the loss correction using 9Be is magnified, whereas the error associated with uncorrected ages decreases because the 10Be is more strongly retained as chemical weathering progresses. We also find that the reactive transport model confirms a set of simple mass balance descriptions, providing guidance for future data collection. Collectively, the modeling results suggest that measurement of Be isotopes in weathered regolith provides a unique approach to determine both surface ages and chemical weathering rates.},

There is a specific need to quantify SOC change for use in national greenhouse gas (GHG) emission inventories. We quantified the response of SOC stocks to manure application from a large worldwide pool of individual studies and determined the impact of explanatory factors such as climate, soil properties, land use and manure characteristics. Our study is based on a meta-analysis of 42 research articles totaling 49 sites and 130 observations in the world. A dominant effect of cumulative manure-C input on SOC response was observed as this factor explained at least 53\% of the variability in SOC stock differences compared to mineral fertilized or unfertilized reference treatments. However, the effects of other determining factors were not evident from our data set. From the linear regression relating cumulative C inputs and SOC stock difference, a global manure-C retention coefficient of 12\% ± 4 (95\% Confidence Interval, CI) could be estimated for an average study duration of 18 years. Following an approach comparable to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we estimated a relative SOC change factor of 1.26 ± 0.14 (95\% CI) which was also related to cumulative manure-C input. Our results offer some scope for the refinement of manure retention coefficients used in crop management guidelines and for the improvement of SOC change factors for national GHG inventories by taking into account manure-C input. Finally, this study emphasizes the need to further document the long-term impact of manure characteristics such as animal species, especially pig and poultry, and manure management systems, in particular liquid vs. solid storage. © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd Reproduced with the permission of the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.},

To address this matter, we assessed the influence of soil geochemistry on bulk SOM composition along a soil chronosequence in California, USA, spanning 3 million years. This was done by combining data on soil mineralogy and texture from previous studies with additional measurements on total carbon (C), stable isotope values (δ13C and δ15N), and spectral information derived from diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). To assess qualitative shifts in bulk SOM, we analysed the peak areas of simple plant-derived (S-POM), complex plant-derived (C-POM), and predominantly microbial-derived organic matter (OM; MOM) and their changes in abundance across soils with several millennia to millions of years of weathering and soil development. We observed that SOM became increasingly stabilized and microbial-derived (lower Cg:gN ratio, increasing δ13C and δ15N) as soil weathering progressed. Peak areas of S-POM (i.e. aliphatic root exudates) did not change over time, while peak areas of C-POM (lignin) and MOM (components of microbial cell walls (amides, quinones, and ketones)) increased over time and depth and were closely related to clay content and pedogenic iron oxides. Hence, our study suggests that with progressing soil development, SOM composition co-varied with changes in the mineral matrix. Our study indicates that structurally more complex OM compounds (C-POM, MOM) play an increasingly important role in soil carbon stabilization mechanisms as the mineral soil matrix becomes increasingly weathered.},

  abstract = {We use an empirical method where model output uncertainties are expressed as a prediction interval (PI) of the underlying distribution of prediction errors. This method obviates the need to identify and determine the contribution of each source of uncertainty to the overall prediction uncertainty. Conceptually, in the context of digital soil mapping, rather than a single point estimate at every prediction location, a PI, characterised by upper and lower prediction limits, encloses the prediction (which lies somewhere on the interval) and ideally the true but unknown value 100(1. - α). \% of times on average the target variable (typically 95\%). The idea is to partition the environmental covariate feature space into clusters which share similar attributes using fuzzy k-means with extragrades. Model error for predicting a target variable is then estimated from which cluster PIs are constructed on the basis of the empirical distribution of errors associated with the observations belonging to each cluster. PIs for each non-calibration observation are then formulated on the basis of the grade of membership each has to each cluster.We demonstrate how we can apply this method for mapping continuous soil depth functions. First, using soil depth functions and digital soil mapping (DSM) methods, we map the continuous vertical and lateral distribution of organic carbon (OC) and available water capacity (AWC) across the Edgeroi district in north-western NSW, Australia. From those predictions we define a continuous PI for each prediction node, generating upper and lower prediction limits of both attributes. From an external validation dataset, preliminary results are encouraging where 91\% and 93\% of the OC and AWC observations respectively fall within the bounds of their 95\% PIs. Ideally, 95\% of instances should fall within these bounds. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {In this paper a spatial downscaling method is explored for generating appropriate farm scale digital soil maps. The digital soil map product to be downscaled is an Australian national extent soil carbon map (100??m grid resolution). Taking into account the associated prediction uncertainties of this map, we used a simulation approach based on Gaussian random fields to generate plausible mapping realisations that were in turn downscaled to 10??m resolution for a farm in North-western NSW, Australia. We were able to derive both a downscaled map of soil carbon and associated prediction variance with this approach. Building further upon this development, we then incorporated a bias correction step into the spatial downscaling procedure which permits the inclusion of field observations as a way to moderate the downscaling results to better reflect actual conditions on the ground. Based on an independent validation dataset, it was found that incorporating field observations increase the concordance correlation coefficient to 0.8 from 0.2. This relatively lower correlation achieved using spatial downscaling alone was due to the national scale mapping for the study area being positively biased in the area of interest. It was found that downscaling that incorporates observational data was marginally better if not comparable to using a point-based digital soil mapping approach. The advantage of spatial downscaling is that it can be implemented in situations of data scarcity. This will be ideal for on farm soil monitoring in situations where detailed soil mapping is initially not available. For example, soil carbon auditing schemes requiring prior soil information for implementation of design-based soil sampling could potentially be universally applied with such a spatial downscaling approach.},

We compute and compare these distributions for different network. configurations, ranging from the simple individual compartment, to series and parallel linear compartments, feedback systems, and models assuming a continuous distribution of decay constants. We also derive the transit time and age distributions of some complex, widely used soil carbon models (the compartmental models CENTURY and Rothamsted, and the continuous-quality Q-Model), and discuss them in the context of long-term carbon sequestration in soils. We show how complex models including feedback loops and slow compartments have distributions with heavier tails than simpler models. Power law tails emerge when using continuous-quality models, indicating long retention times for an important fraction of soil carbon. The responsiveness of the soil system to changes in decay constants due to altered climatic conditions or plant species composition is found to be stronger when all compartments respond equally to the environmental change, and when the slower compartments are more sensitive than the faster ones or lose more carbon through microbial respiration.

  abstract = {Carbon (C) metabolism is at the core of ecosystem function. Decomposers play a critical role in this metabolism as they drive soil C cycle by mineralizing organic matter to CO(2). Their growth depends on the carbon-use efficiency (CUE), defined as the ratio of growth over C uptake. By definition, high CUE promotes growth and possibly C stabilization in soils, while low CUE favors respiration. Despite the importance of this variable, flexibility in CUE for terrestrial decomposers is still poorly characterized and is not represented in most biogeochemical models. Here, we synthesize the theoretical and empirical basis of changes in CUE across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, highlighting common patterns and hypothesizing changes in CUE under future climates. Both theoretical considerations and empirical evidence from aquatic organisms indicate that CUE decreases as temperature increases and nutrient availability decreases. More limited evidence shows a similar sensitivity of CUE to temperature and nutrient availability in terrestrial decomposers. Increasing CUE with improved nutrient availability might explain observed declines in respiration from fertilized stands, while decreased CUE with increasing temperature and plant C : N ratios might decrease soil C storage. Current biogeochemical models could be improved by accounting for these CUE responses along environmental and stoichiometric gradients.},

The interactions between microbes, soil carbon (C), and water availability are particularly complex, as they involve coupled physical (advection and diffusion in unsaturated media) and biochemical processes (enzymatic reactions, C uptake by microbes). Here we propose an approximated equation based on a quasi-equilibrium assumption that describes microbial uptake of soil C as a function of soil moisture and organic matter content during soil drying. The equation predicts that uptake depends on two terms, one dependent on soil organic C concentration and enzyme availability (analogous to a Michaelis-Menten equation) and one dependent on soil moisture via its effects on enzyme and solute mass transfer, and microbial uptake kinetics. Assuming that uptake is proportional to microbial respiration, model results are compared to measured respiration-water potential curves. Using independently estimated parameter values (except for the calibrated microbial uptake efficiency), the theoretical model captures well the respiration decline during drying and provides an explanation of respiration pulses at rewetting. Thus, this simple formulation could be employed in ecosystem models as an alternative to empirical respiration-moisture response functions.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Soil drying and wetting cycles promote carbon (C) release through large heterotrophic respiration pulses at rewetting, known as the “Birch” effect. Empirical evidence shows that drier conditions before rewetting and larger changes in soil moisture at rewetting cause larger respiration pulses. Because soil moisture varies in response to rainfall, these respiration pulses also depend on the random timing and intensity of precipitation. In addition to rewetting pulses, heterotrophic respiration continues during soil drying, eventually ceasing when soils are too dry to sustain microbial activity. The importance of respiration pulses in contributing to the overall soil heterotrophic respiration flux has been demonstrated empirically, but no theoretical investigation has so far evaluated how the relative contribution of these pulses may change along climatic gradients or as precipitation regimes shift in a given location. To fill this gap, we start by assuming that heterotrophic respiration rates during soil drying and pulses at rewetting can be treated as random variables dependent on soil moisture fluctuations, and we develop a stochastic model for soil heterotrophic respiration rates that analytically links the statistical properties of respiration to those of precipitation. Model results show that both the mean rewetting pulse respiration and the mean respiration during drying increase with increasing mean precipitation. However, the contribution of respiration pulses to the total heterotrophic respiration increases with decreasing precipitation frequency and to a lesser degree with decreasing precipitation depth, leading to an overall higher contribution of respiration pulses under future more intermittent and intense precipitation. Specifically, higher rainfall intermittency at constant total rainfall can increase the contribution of respiration pulses up to ∼10 \% or 20 \% of the total heterotrophic respiration in mineral and organic soils, respectively. Moreover, the variability of both components of soil heterotrophic respiration is also predicted to increase under these conditions. Therefore, with future more intermittent precipitation, respiration pulses and the associated nutrient release will intensify and become more variable, contributing more to soil biogeochemical cycling.},

  abstract = {The Mat??rn variogram model has been advocated because it is flexible and can represent varied behaviour at small lags. We show how the constraints on the spherical and exponential variogram at short lags ignore a possible source of uncertainty in the variogram and so in kriging surveys, that the Mat??rn model can describe. Mat??rn, spherical and exponential variogram models were fitted by maximum likelihood to a set of log10(K) observations made on a regular grid at Broom's Barn Farm, Suffolk, England. The likelihood profiles of the Mat??rn parameter estimates were asymmetric. Thus the uncertainty of these estimates could only be adequately assessed by a Bayesian approach. The uncertainty of estimated parameters of the Mat??rn variogram was larger than for the exponential variogram. This is an indication that the assumption of an exponential model limits the behaviour that may be described by the variogram. Thus uncertainty analyses where an exponential variogram is assumed may underestimate the uncertainty of kriged estimates. Bayesian analysis of the kriged estimates of log10(K) at Broom's Barn Farm using the Mat??rn variogram revealed an observable component of uncertainty due to variogram uncertainty. When an exponential variogram model was used, the estimate of this component of uncertainty was negligible. The Mat??rn variogram should therefore be used rather than the exponential model when assessing the adequacy of a variogram estimate. A method of designing sample schemes which is suitable for both estimating a Mat??rn variogram and interpolation is suggested. ?? 2007.},

We used soil morphology, lysimetry, isotopes, and spectroscopy to investigate the role of preferential flow paths in the delivery of carbon (C) to the subsoil. High rainfall, high primary productivity, and the dominance of highly reactive, short‐range‐order minerals combine to sequester substantial stocks of soil C with long mean residence times. The soils have large peds, separated by wide cracks, which form a network of channels propagating downward through the top 40 to 60 cm, facilitating macropore flow. The channel infillings and crack surfaces were enriched in organic material (OM) with lower C: N ratios, and had higher ammonium oxalate‐extractable Al, and lower ammonium oxalate‐extractable Fe than the adjacent mineral bulk soil. CP MAS 13C‐NMR spectra ofOMaccumulating at depth showed strong signal intensities in the carboxyl and carbonyl C regions, indicative of organic acids, while decaying roots showed greater contributions of aromatic and O‐alkyl C. The ratios of alkyl‐to‐O‐alkyl C in the organic infillings were more similar to those of the bulk Bh and to dissolved organic matter than to those of decaying roots. Radiocarbon‐based ages of OM infillings at {$>$}50 cm depth were significantly younger than the mineral soil (2000 years versus 7000 years). Respired CO2 from incubated soils showed that OM accumulating at depth is a mixture of modern and much older C, providing further evidence for the downward movement of fresh C.},

  abstract = {In soils, dissolved organic matter (DOM) is probably the most bioavailable fraction of soil organic matter, since all microbial uptake mechanisms require a water environment. Bioavailability describes the potential of microorganisms to interact with DOM. It is a prerequisite for biodegradation and can be restricted, if DOM is present in small pores or within soil aggregates and therefore not accessible for microorganisms. DOM biodegradation is defined as the utilisation of organic compounds by soil microorganisms quantified by the disappearance of DOM or O 2 or by the evolution of CO 2 . The controlling factors for DOM biodegradability can be divided into three groups, namely, intrinsic DOM quality parameters, soil and solution parameters and external factors. DOM characteristics that generally enhance its biodegradability are high contents of carbohydrates, organic acids and proteins for which the hydrophilic neutral fraction seems to be a good estimate. In contrast, aromatic and hydrophobic structures that can also be assessed by UV absorbance decrease DOM biodegradability, either due to their recalcitrance or due to inhibiting effects on enzyme activity. Effects of solution parameters such as Al, Fe, Ca and heavy metal concentrations on DOM biodegradability have been documented in various studies, however with different, sometimes conflicting results. Inhibitory effects of metals are generally attributed to toxicity of the organic complexes or the free metal ions. In contrast, the enhanced degradability observed in the presence of metal ions may be due to flocculation, as larger structures will provide better attachment for microbial colonies. As degradation is dependent on microbial activity, the composition and density of the microbial population used in the degradation studies also influence biodegradation. Site-specific factors, such as vegetation, land use and seasonality of meteorological parameters control DOM composition and soil and soil solution properties and therefore also affect its biodegradability. The major obstacle for a better understanding of the controls of DOM biodegradability is the lack of a standardised methodology or at least systematic comparisons between the large number of methods used to assess DOM biodegradability. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Traditionally, the selective preservation of certain recalcitrant organic compounds and the formation of recalcitrant humic substances have been regarded as an important mechanism for soil organic matter (SOM) stabilization. Based on a critical overview of available methods and on results from a cooperative research program, this paper evaluates how relevant recalcitrance is for the long-term stabilization of SOM or its fractions. Methodologically, recalcitrance is difficult to assess, since the persistence of certain SOM fractions or specific compounds may also be caused by other stabilization mechanisms, such as physical protection or chemical interactions with mineral surfaces. If only free particulate SOM obtained from density fractionation is considered, it rarely reaches ages exceeding 50 y. Older light particles have often been identified as charred plant residues or as fossil C. The degradability of the readily bioavailable dissolved or water-extractable OM fraction is often negatively correlated with its content in aromatic compounds, which therefore has been associated with recalcitrance. But in subsoils, dissolved organic matter aromaticity and biodegradability both are very low, indicating that other factors or compounds limit its degradation. Among the investigated specific compounds, lignin, lipids, and their derivatives have mean turnover times faster or similar as that of bulk SOM. Only a small fraction of the lignin inputs seems to persist in soils and is mainly found in the fine textural size fraction ({$<$}20 µm), indicating physico-chemical stabilization. Compound-specific analysis of 13C : 12C ratios of SOM pyrolysis products in soils with C3-C4 crop changes revealed no compounds with mean residence times of {$>$} 40–50 y, unless fossil C was present in substantial amounts, as at a site exposed to lignite inputs in the past. Here, turnover of pyrolysis products seemed to be much longer, even for those attributed to carbohydrates or proteins. Apparently, fossil C from lignite coal is also utilized by soil organisms, which is further evidenced by low 14C concentrations in microbial phospholipid fatty acids from this site. Also, black C from charred plant materials was susceptible to microbial degradation in a short-term (60 d) and a long-term (2 y) incubation experiment. This degradation was enhanced, when glucose was supplied as an easily available microbial substrate. Similarly, SOM mineralization in many soils generally increased after addition of carbohydrates, amino acids, or simple organic acids, thus indicating that stability may also be caused by substrate limitations. It is concluded that the presented results do not provide much evidence that the selective preservation of recalcitrant primary biogenic compounds is a major SOM-stabilization mechanism. Old SOM fractions with slow turnover rates were generally only found in association with soil minerals. The only not mineral-associated SOM components that may be persistent in soils appear to be black and fossil C.},

  abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays a major role in the global carbon budget. It can act as a source or a sink of atmospheric carbon, thereby possibly influencing the course of climate change. Improving the tools that model the spatial distributions of SOC stocks at national scales is a priority, both for monitoring changes in SOC and as an input for global carbon cycles studies. In this paper, we compare and evaluate two recent and promising modelling approaches. First, we considered several increasingly complex boosted regression trees (BRT), a convenient and efficient multiple regression model from the statistical learning field. Further, we considered a robust geostatistical approach coupled to the BRT models. Testing the different approaches was performed on the dataset from the French Soil Monitoring Network, with a consistent cross-validation procedure. We showed that when a limited number of predictors were included in the BRT model, the standalone BRT predictions were significantly improved by robust geostatistical modelling of the residuals. However, when data for several SOC drivers were included, the standalone BRT model predictions were not significantly improved by geostatistical modelling.

Cox is also related to ecosystem oxidative ratio (OR), the molar ratio of O-2 to CO2 fluxes associated with net ecosystem exchange (NEE). Here we compare two methods for measuring Cox and OR: (1) \% C, \% H, \% N, and \% O elemental analysis, and (2) heat of combustion (Delta H-c) measured by means of bomb calorimetry coupled with \% C elemental analysis (hereafter referred to as calorimetry). Compared with \% C, \% N, \% H, and \% O elemental analysis, calorimetry generates Cox and OR data more rapidly and cheaply. However, calorimetric measurements yield less accurate Cox and OR data. We additionally report Cox and OR data for a pair of biomass standards and a suite of biomass samples. The OR values we measured in these samples were less variable than OR data reported in the literature (generated by simultaneous measurement of ecosystem O-2 and CO2 gas mixing ratios). Our biomass OR values had a mean of 1.03 and range of 0.99 - 1.06. These estimates are lower than the OR value of 1.10 that is often used to partition uptake of fossil fuel CO2 between the ocean and the terrestrial biosphere.},

  abstract = {The response of soil carbon dynamics to climate and land-use change will affect both the future climate and the quality of ecosystems. Deep soil carbon ({$>$} 20cm) is the primary component of the soil carbon pool, but the dynamics of deep soil carbon remains poorly understood. Therefore, radiocarbon activity (ΔD(14) C), which is a function of the age of carbon, may help to understand rates of soil carbon biodegradation and stabilization. We analyzed the published (14) C contents in 122 profiles of mineral soil that were well distributed in most of the large world biomes, except for the boreal zone. With a multivariate extension of a linear mixed effects model whose inference was based on the parallel combination of two algorithms, the Expectation-Maximization (EM) and the Metropolis-Hasting algorithms, we expressed soil Δ(14) C profiles as a four-parameter function of depth. The four-parameter model produced insightful predictions of soil Δ(14) C as dependent on depth, soil type, climate, vegetation, land-use and date of sampling (R2 = 0.68). Further analysis with the model showed that the age of topsoil carbon was primarily affected by climate and cultivation. By contrast, the age of deep soil carbon was affected more by soil taxa than by climate and thus illustrated the strong dependence of soil carbon dynamics on other pedologic traits such as clay content and mineralogy.

  abstract = {In previous studies, Al extracted by acid ammonium acetate (Ala) or Na-pyrophosphate (Alp), rather than silt or clay content and climate conditions, was the most important factor that controls organic matter (OM) levels in volcanic soils. Here, the hypothesis was tested that Ala is a comparable method (as much as CuCl2) to quantify the proportion of Al bound to OM in allophanic soils. As far as we know, there are no previous antecedents in which selective dissolution method has been compared with this extractant. Secondly, we examine the effects of (a) Al, (b) silt plus clay content (particles size 0-53 μm) and (c) clay mineralogy on the control of organic carbon (OC) level in Chilean volcanic soils. This was achieved by sampling 16 soils series (11 Andisols, one Alfisol and four Ultisols, USDA classification) including 48 soil pedons up to 0.4 m depth. Soils were analyzed for Ala, Alp, oxalate (Alo, Sio and Feo), cold NaOH (Aln) and un-buffered salts, CuCl2 (AlCu), LaCl3 (AlLa) and KCl (Alk). We also measured the Al-humus as soluble C fraction after pyrophosphate extraction and the C associated to the silt plus clay fraction after sonication and gravity decantation. The statistical package (S)MATR was used to examine bivariate linear regressions among soil properties by computing the standardized major axis (SMA). Our results indicate that Ala had a good correspondence with Alp (R2 = 0.76) in the top soil with Ala/Alp ratio of 0.19 and both extractans presented significant and positively relationship with soil OC (R2 {$>$} 0.62). Acid ammonium acetate was as effective as AlCu to determine the Al-OM in allophanic soils. It is cheaper than AlCu and Alp and 0.5 h shaking is required compared to 2 h of AlCu and 16 h of Alp. The efficiency of the extraction was: Aln ≥ Alo {$>$} Alp {$>$} AlCu ≥ Ala {$>$} AlLa {$>$} Alk. We also found that allophane content (estimated by Al/Si ratio) was strongly correlated (R2 = 0.82) with the OC in the fine silt plus clay and that Al-humus together with C in the finest particles explained (R2 {$>$} 0.60) the largest proportion of variation of soil OC across studied soils. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Riparian buffers, the vegetated region adjacent to streams and wetlands, are thought to be effective at intercepting and reducing nitrogen loads entering water bodies. Riparian buffer width is thought to be positively related to nitrogen removal effectiveness by influencing nitrogen retention or removal. We surveyed the scientific literature containing data on riparian buffers and nitrogen concentration in streams and groundwater to identify trends between nitrogen removal effectiveness and buffer width, hydrological flow path, and vegetative cover. Nitrogen removal effectiveness varied widely. Wide buffers ({$>$}50 m) more consistently removed significant portions of nitrogen entering a riparian zone than narrow buffers (0-25 m). Buffers of various vegetation types were equally effective at removing nitrogen but buffers composed of herbaceous and forest/herbaceous vegetation were more effective when wider. Subsurface removal of nitrogen was efficient, but did not appear to be related to buffer width, while surface removal of nitrogen was partly related to buffer width. The mass of nitrate nitrogen removed per unit length of buffer did not differ by buffer width, flow path, or buffer vegetation type. Our meta-analysis suggests that buffer width is an important consideration in managing nitrogen in watersheds. However, the inconsistent effects of buffer width and vegetation on nitrogen removal suggest that soil type, subsurface hydrology (e.g., soil saturation, groundwater flow paths), and subsurface biogeochemistry (organic carbon supply, nitrate inputs) also are important factors governing nitrogen removal in buffers.},

  abstract = {The distribution of soil organic carbon (OC) in the landscape shows high variability between landform positions. Soils in depositional sites are characterized by a highly diverse vertical structure and can contain significant amounts of OC over the whole soil profile. However, anthropogenic modifications of the landscape such as land use and artificial drainage can significantly alter the OC balance in a catchment. Here, we analyse the spatial distribution of OC stocks along an agriculturally used catena in a catchment, tributary to the Danube River in the Bavarian Forest in Southern Germany. The combination of geomorphic aspects with highly detailed soil data based on 16 soil profiles along a catena allowed us to closely examine the relationship between soil OC and the factors of landform position, soil inherent properties and grassland vs. cropland land use. We determined bulk density, total carbon (TC) and inorganic carbon (IC) for each soil horizon in order to quantify OC stocks and picture the vertical OC distribution in the soils. Pedogenic oxides were analysed as an indicator for the redox conditions as well as the soil development. Furthermore, we analysed the clay fraction as well as poorly crys- talline iron oxides (FeOX) as potential binding agents for OC. The persistence of OC in the landform positions could be designated by the proportion of 14C content of the bulk soil OC. Our data revealed that the amount of OC stored in the topsoil is mostly determined by land use, but subsoil OC stocks highly depend on landform position. Most OC of this catena is stored in the floodplain featuring particularly high amounts of OC in their subsoils. Radiocarbon signatures of the floodplain OC indicated a young 14C age compared to the footslope subsoils. We assume that these high OC stocks were due to 1.) formerly high input of OC-rich sediments, 2.) preservation of this OC from decomposition due to high water saturation and 3.) current land use (grassland). Dropping of the ground water table due to artificial drainage measures left detectable footprints within a few decades in the depth distribution of pedogenic iron oxides and indicated currently dominant oxic conditions within the uppermost 100 cm of the floodplain soils. We suspect that under these conditions the OC stocks are now vulnerable to OC losses. Even though we found no correlation between FeOX and OC, it can be assumed that the interplay between FeOX and OC will play a key role for the stabilization of the floodplain OC in the future. Today most floodplains in Central Europe are not in their natural state, but drained and under agricultural land use. Therefore this work points to the necessity of monitoring the OC pools in these landform positions and to consider quick responses when it comes to changes in the hydrologic regime and/or land-use system.},

The P sorption chemistry of the dominant P species in a polyphosphate fertiliser (pyrophosphate and orthophosphate) was compared on a range of Australian soils, and the effect of these P species on equilibrium solution chemistry was also examined. Phosphorus supplied as pyrophosphate had a stronger sorption affinity than orthophosphate in all soils. The greater efficiency of pyrophosphate-based fertiliser on some soil types is therefore not due to reduced sorption of this P supplied as pyrophosphate compared to P supplied as orthophosphate fertiliser. In general, the addition of pyrophosphate to soil resulted in a larger decrease in calcium concentration in solution compared to orthophosphate. In contrast, there was an increase in iron concentration in solution with pyrophosphate addition, indicating sequestration reactions associated with the dissolution of dissolved organic carbon into soil solution. The pyrophosphate ion generally mobilised more Fe into solution than orthophosphate in several soils, likely through complexation reactions leading to Fe desorption/dissolution from the soil solid phase. These findings highlight the differences in soil chemical reactions that occur with the addition of polyphosphate fertilisers, which may contribute to their yield advantage in some soil types.},

We discuss the various methods that have been, or could be, used for fitting quantitative relationships between soil properties or classes and their 'environment'. These include generalised linear models, classification and regression trees, neural networks, fuzzy systems and geostatistics. We also review the data layers that have been, or could be, used to describe the 'environment'. Terrain attributes derived from digital elevation models, and spectral reflectance bands from satellite imagery, have been the most commonly used, but there is a large potential for new data layers. The generic framework, which we call the scorpan-SSPFe (soil spatial prediction function with spatially autocorrelated errors) method, is particularly relevant for those places where soil resource information is limited. It is based on the seven predictive scorpan factors, a generalisation of Jenny's five factors, namely: (1) s: soil, other or previously measured attributes of the soil at a point; (2) c: climate, climatic properties of the environment at a point; (3) o: organisms, including land cover and natural vegetation; (4) r: topography, including terrain attributes and classes; (5) p: parent material, including lithology; (6) a: age, the time factor; (7) n: space, spatial or geographic position. Interactions (*) between these factors are also considered. The scorpan-SSPFe method essentially involves the following steps: (i) Define soil attribute(s) of interest and decide resolution ρ and block size β. (ii) Assemble data layers to represent Q. (iii) Spatial decomposition or lagging of data layers. (iv) Sampling of assembled data (Q) to obtain sampling sites. (v) GPS field sampling and laboratory analysis to obtain soil class or property data. (vi) Fit quantitative relationships (observing Ockham's razor) with autocorrelated errors, (vii) Predict digital map. (viii) Field sampling and laboratory analysis for corroboration and quality testing. (ix) If necessary, simplify legend or decrease resolution by returning to (i) or improve map by returning to (v).

  abstract = {Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) is attracting much interest in the soil science community because it has a number of advantages over conventional methods of soil analyses. The techniques are more rapid, timely, cheaper and hence more efficient at obtaining the data when a large number of samples and analysis are required. Moreover, a single spectrum may be used to assess various physical, chemical and biological soil properties. Until now, research in soil spectroscopy has focused on spectral calibration and prediction of soil properties using multivariate statistics. In this paper we show how these predictions may be used in an inference system to predict other important and functional soil properties using pedotransfer functions (PTFs). Thus we propose the use of soil spectral calibration and its predictions as input and as a complement to a soil inference system (SPEC-SINFERS). We demonstrate the implementation of SPEC-SINFERS with two examples. As a first step, soil mid-infrared (MIR) spectra and partial least squares (PLS) regression are used to estimate soil pH, clay, silt, sand, organic carbon content and cation exchange capacity. A bootstrap method is used to determine the uncertainties of these predictions. These predictions and their uncertainties are then used as input into the inference system, where established PTFs are used to infer (i) soil water content and (ii) soil pH buffering capacity together with their uncertainties. An important feature of SPEC-SINFERS is the propagation of both input and model uncertainties. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) spectral range has increasingly been utilised in recent years to measure soil properties, including organic carbon and macronutrient content, cation exchange capacity, pH, and even trace metal concentration. Proponents have even suggested that conventional laboratory soil testing methods can ultimately be replaced by these less laborious and more rapid spectroscopic methods. However, to this point in time, reflectance spectroscopy has not demonstrated accuracy comparable to that of conventional physical–chemical testing methods. This review explains why correlations between VNIR spectral features and specific chemical properties within selected sets of soil samples are indirect at best and therefore cannot be trusted more universally to predict soil chemical properties in larger and less homogeneous sample sets. Because mathematical manipulation of the raw spectral data has become increasingly complex and obscure to the users, particularly when machine learning is employed, the possibility exists that the correlations found and the predictions made are based on chance relationships resulting from overfitting the spectral data to include random noise in addition to any real trends. It is concluded that, for real-world soil testing for agronomic and environmental purposes (e.g. available nutrient and trace metal levels), spectral reflectance methods are not sufficiently reliable to replace conventional testing. Conversely, these reflectance methods show utility and convenience in measuring general trends across landscapes in levels of soil organic matter, carbonates, soluble salts and specific clay minerals. Highlights: VNIR reflectance spectroscopy is reviewed as a method to measure soil properties. Estimating most soil chemical properties by VNIR relies on indirect or proxy correlations. Complex regression models used in predicting soil properties may overstate accuracy. Reflectance spectroscopy has lower reliability and extrapolability than conventional soil testing.},

  abstract = {Increased interest in implementing projects in the Sahel region of Africa for sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide in soil organic matter has intensified the need for methods that accurately measure soil C but which are also suitable for use by most resource limited soil analysis laboratories in the region. The challenge is amplified by the low carbon content of the degraded soils found on agricultural lands in the region (often less than 5 g kg(-1) soil). Various indirect methods have been recommended for estimating soil C which can be readily implemented in a limited resource environment but they require more evaluation in terms of accuracy. This study compares soil carbon results obtained by direct elemental analysis using dry combustion to estimates obtained by indirect methods such as dichromate oxidation, mass loss-on-ignition (LOI), and diffused reflectance infrared spectroscopy that has advantages in being simple, inexpensive, and/or rapid. The results showed that both dichromate oxidation and loss-on-ignition had substantial limitations when used to analyze the low carbon soils within the region. Diffused reflectance spectroscopy using either the near- or mid-infrared spectral regions performed well for predicting soil organic carbon as well as sand, silt and clay content. These results indicate that once calibrated, infrared spectroscopy holds great promise for quantifying soil properties in the Sahel region and that regional laboratories could adopt the technology if instrumentation were made available.},

  abstract = {Soil erosion continuously redistributes soil and associated soil organic matter (SOM) on the Earth's surface, with important implications for biogeochemical cycling of essential elements and terrestrial carbon sequestration. Despite the importance of soil erosion, surprisingly few studies have evaluated the sources of eroded carbon (C). We used natural abundance levels of the stable and radioactive isotopes of C (13C and 14C) and stable isotope of nitrogen (15N) to elucidate the origins of SOM eroded from low-order catchments along the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada of California, USA. Our work was conducted in two relatively undisturbed catchments (low elevation = 1800 m, and high elevation = 2300 m) of the Kings River Experimental Watersheds (KREW) in the Sierra National Forest. Sediment captured in basins at the outlet of each gauged watershed were compared to possible source materials, which included: upland surficial organic horizons (i.e., forest floor) and mineral soils (0–0.6 m) from three landform positions (i.e., crest, backslope, and toeslope), stream bank soils (0–0.6 m), and stream-bed materials (0–0.05 m). We found that most of the organic matter (OM) in the captured sediments was composed of O-horizon material that had high C concentrations. Radiocarbon analyses also showed that the captured OM is composed of modern (post-1950) C, with fraction modern values at or above 1.0. Our results suggest that surface (sheet) erosion, as opposed to channeling through established streams and episodic mass wasting events, is likely the largest source of sediment exported out of these minimally disturbed, headwater catchments. The erosional export of sediment with a high concentration of C, especially in the form of relatively undecomposed litter from the O horizon, suggests that a large fraction of the exported C is likely to be decomposed during or after erosion; hence, it is unlikely that soil erosion acts as a significant net sink for atmospheric CO2 in these low-order, temperate forest catchments.},

We compared soil carbon dynamics at five broadleaf forests in the Eastern US that vary in climate, soil type, and soil ecology: two sites at the University of Michigan Biological Station (MI-Coarse, sandy; MI-Fine, loamy); Bartlett Experimental Forest (NH-BF); Harvard Forest (MA-HF); and Baskett Wildlife Recreation and Education Area (MO-OZ). We quantified soil carbon stocks and measured bulk soil radiocarbon to at least 60 cm depth. We determined surface (0-15 cm) soil carbon distribution and turnover times in free light (unprotected), occluded light (intra-aggregate), and dense (mineral-associated) soil fractions. Total soil carbon stocks ranged from 55 ± 4 to 229 ± 42 Mg C ha-1 and were lowest at MI-Coarse and MO-OZ and highest at MI-Fine and NH-BF. Differences in climate only partly explained differences in soil organic matter 14C and mean turnover times, which were 75-260 year for free-light fractions, 70-625 year for occluded-light fractions, and 90-480 year for dense fractions. Turnover times were shortest at the warmest site, but longest at the northeastern sites (NH-BF and MA-HF), rather than the coldest sites (MI-Coarse and MI-Fine). Soil texture, mineralogy, drainage, and macrofaunal activity may be at least as important as climate in determining soil carbon dynamics in temperate broadleaf forests. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  abstract = {The rate of exchange of CO2 between the soil and the atmosphere depends on the stability of the organic carbon stored in the soil. Recent studies show that carbon stored in the subsoil is characterised by larger turnover times than the carbon stored in the topsoil. Consequently, identification of the depth at which high/low amounts of SOC are stored is essential for applying sustainable management of the soil in the light of global warming and related threats. This study investigates the depth distribution of SOC in relation to land use and soil type based on a large dataset for Flanders (Belgium). Soil type determines the SOC content along the entire profile. On the contrary, land use appears to have a strong influence on SOC content in the top layers of the profile, but doesn't play a significant role at the bottom of the profile ({$>$} 1??m depth). SOC content near the surface of the profile is remarkably higher in fine (clay) textured soils than in coarse (sand) textured soils and tends to increase by increasing soil wetness under sand and silt textured soils. SOC at the bottom of the profile increases as well by increasing soil wetness, but only in fine (clay and silt) textured soils. The rate of decline of SOC content with depth depends on texture and land use. Under forest this decline is remarkably fast, although less so in the more sandy soil types. The overall model predicts the distribution of SOC density by depth using land use and soil type information and allows in its integrated form the estimation of SOC stocks that can be represented on SOC maps until a reference depth free of choice. Applying this model, based on a three-dimensional spatial distribution approach, the total amount of SOC stored in Flanders is calculated at 62.20 ?? 0.72??Mt C for the top 0.3??m and 103.19 ?? 1.27??Mt C for the top 1??m. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The global soil carbon amount, of about 1,500 Gt C, is approximately twice the amount of atmosphere C. Therefore, soil has major impact on atmospheric CO2, and, in turn, climate change. Soil organic carbon further controls many soil properties such as fertility, water retention and aggregate stability. Nonetheless, precise mechanisms ruling interactions between soil organic carbon and environmental factors are not well known at the large scale. Indeed, most soil investigations have been conducted at the plot scale using a limited number of factors. Therefore, a national soil survey of 2,158 soil samples from France was carried out to measure soil properties such as texture, organic carbon, nitrogen and heavy metal content. Here, we studied factors controlling soil organic carbon at the national scale using a model based on stepwise linear regression. Factors analysed were land use, soil texture, rock fragment content, climate and land management. We used several criteria for model selection, such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC), the corrected AIC rule and the Bayesian information criterion. Results show that organic carbon concentrations in fine earth increase with increasing rock fragment content, depending on land use and texture. Spreading farmyard manure and slurry induces higher carbon concentrations mostly in wet and stony grasslands. Nonetheless, a negative correlation has been found between carbon and direct C input from animal excrements on grasslands. Our findings will therefore help to define better land management practices to sequester soil carbon.},

Measuring the RF density (rRF) is labor intensive and time consuming, so the volume of RFs is often estimat- ed based on measured RF mass and constant values for rRF. In this study, we determined the rRF of 87 soils in Germany and showed how different rRF of limestone affected the calculation of BDFF and SOC stocks. For limestone, the measured rRF in our soils was lower (2.49 ± 0.14 g cm-3) than a constant value of 2.70 g cm-3. The average difference in BDFF and SOC was 2.30 and 2.35\%, respectively, which was lower than errors that arose from sampling or analyt- ical techniques. However, differences in the BDFF and SOC stocks can be as high as 37\% when rRF is below 2.20 g cm-3 and there is an increase in the subsoil RF content of up to 70\%. Therefore, accurately determining the rRF, at least in the subsoil, is recommended when RFs dominate the total volume of the sample to reduce potential measurement errors. The necessity of using the actual rRF instead of using a constant value depends on the variation in rRF, the RF content, and the intended accuracy of the BDFF and SOC stock estimation.

  abstract = {The contribution of different C inputs to organic carbon accumulation within the soil profile in the Ultuna long-term continuous soil organic matter experiment, established in 1956, was determined. Until 1999, C3-crops were grown at the site, but since then maize (C4) has been the only crop. The effect of a total of 10 different inorganic nitrogen and organic amendment treatments (4Mg Cha−1yr−1) on SOC in topsoil and subsoil after 53 years was evaluated and the contribution from maize roots to SOC after 10 years of cultivation was estimated. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and δ13C signature were measured down to 50cm depth. The C content in the topsoil (0–20cm depth) was 1.5\% at the start of the experiment. After 53 years of treatments, the average topsoil C content varied between 0.9 and 3.8\% of soil dry weight, with the open fallow having the lowest and the peat amended the highest value. Nitrogen seemed to promote C accumulation in the topsoil treatment effects were smaller below 20cm depth and only two of the amendments (peat and sewage sludge) significantly affected SOC content down to 35cm depth. Despite this, penetrometer measurements showed significant treatment differences of compaction below 41cm depth, and although we could not explain these differences this presented some evidence of an initial treatment-induced subsoil differentiation. Ten years of maize growth affected the δ13C of SOC down to 22.5cm depth, where it varied between −25.16 and −26.33(‰), and an isotopic mass balance calculation suggested that maize C accounted for 4–8\% of total SOC in the topsoil. Until less than 2500 years ago the site was a post-glacial sea floor and the 14C data suggest that marine sediment C still dominates the SOC in deeper soil layers. Overall, the results suggest that 53 years of treatments has caused dramatic changes on the stored C in the topsoil in several of the treatments, while the changes in the subsoil is much less dramatic and a small C accumulation in the upper subsoil was found in two of the treatments. The contribution from roots to SOC accumulation was generally equal to or greater than the contribution from amendments. The retention coefficient of root-derived C in the topsoil was on average 0.30±0.09, which is higher than usually reported in the literature for plant residues but confirms previous findings for the same experiment using another approach. This strengthens the conclusion that root-derived SOC contributed more to SOC than above-ground crop residues.},

Here, we examine to what extent the C mineralization of water extractable organic matter (WEOM) and mineral Ah horizon are affected by differing molar ratios of Al and C (Al:C). It has been postulated that an increase in the concentration of Al in the soil solution does not affect the mineralization of WEOM and Ah horizon until a Al:C threshold is reached, at which point mineralization decreases. We hypothesized that dissolved organic C binds Al that is otherwise toxic to soil microorganism in the soil solution. Subsequently, the organic C remaining is mineralized or lost in water sheds. A microcosm experiment was designed where Al was added to WEOM or Ah horizon (0–8 mg L−1 or kg−1). Potential biodegradation was evaluated by trapping CO2 emitted during 15 days of incubation. Additionally, the amount of living fungal cells in the WEOM and microbial biomass of Ah horizon were quantified. The Al complexation was determined by selective dissolution, and characterized by infrared spectroscopy. In general, the carbon mineralization rates and the amount of fungal cells of WEOM were similar to that of the control (0 Al addition) when the Al:C ratio was {$<$}0.16. With increasing Al concentrations, mineralization was reduced up to 80\%, accompanied by the formation of organo-mineral complexes, as indicated by infrared analysis. We conclude that Al exerts fine regulation on C availability necessary for microbial growth in both, WEOM and the Ah horizon.},

Today, passive RS of F is feasible with different prototypes and commercial ground-based, airborne, and even spaceborne instruments under certain conditions. This interest is generating an increasing number of research projects linking F and RS, such as the development of new F remote retrieval techniques, the understanding of the link between the F signal and vegetation physiology and the feasibility of a satellite mission specifically designed for F monitoring. This paper reviews the main issues to be addressed for estimating F from RS observations. Scattered information about F estimation exists in the literature. Here, more than 40 scientific papers dealing with F estimation are reviewed and major differences are found in approaches, instruments and experimental setups. Different approaches are grouped into major categories according to RS data requirements (i.e. radiance or reflectance, multispectral or hyperspectral) and techniques used to extract F from the remote signal. Theoretical assumptions, advantages and drawbacks of each method are outlined and provide perspectives for future research. Finally, applications of the measured F signal at the three scales of observation (ground, aircraft and satellite) are presented and discussed to provide the state of the art in F estimation. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Many processes in nature are modeled using compartmental systems (reservoir/pool/box systems). Usually, they are expressed as a set of first-order differential equations describing the transfer of matter across a network of compartments. The concepts of age of matter in compartments and the time required for particles to transit the system are important diagnostics of these models with applications to a wide range of scientific questions. Until now, explicit formulas for transit-time and age distributions of nonlinear time-dependent compartmental systems were not available. We compute densities for these types of systems under the assumption of well-mixed compartments. Assuming that a solution of the nonlinear system is available at least numerically, we show how to construct a linear time-dependent system with the same solution trajectory. We demonstrate how to exploit this solution to compute transit-time and age distributions in dependence on given start values and initial age distributions. Furthermore, we derive equations for the time evolution of quantiles and moments of the age distributions. Our results generalize available density formulas for the linear time-independent case and mean-age formulas for the linear time-dependent case. As an example, we apply our formulas to a nonlinear and a linear version of a simple global carbon cycle model driven by a time-dependent input signal which represents fossil fuel additions. We derive time-dependent age distributions for all compartments and calculate the time it takes to remove fossil carbon in a business-as-usual scenario.}

  abstract = {Knowledge about spatial patterns of soil respiration (SR) and its temperature sensitivity (Q10) is of emerging relevance for assessing carbon fluxes across the landscape. Related experiments are often conducted under controlled laboratory conditions and usually rely on soil samples, which are sieved and stored. Here, we investigated the effect ofsieving and storage on SR and Q10. We took 14 samples from different land use types and soil textures. Samples were sieved to 2 mm at field-moist conditions and split into four treatments: sieved/no-storage, sieved/freeze-storage (−18 °C), sieved/cold-storage (+ 4 °C), and sieved/dry- storage (+ 40 °C). The storage timewas 7 weeks. Intact soil cores were used as a control. The SRwas not significantly affected by sieving/no-storage, sieving/freeze-storage, and sieving/cold-storage compared with the control. Yet, sieving/dry-storage signif- icantly increased SR but all samples were similarly affected (r = 0.81 for the correlation between SR after sieving/dry-storage and SR in the control). The Q10 ofsieving/no-storage (1.94 ± 0.28), sieving/freeze-storage (1.94 ± 0.23), sieving/cold-storage (2.37 ± 0.29), and sieving/dry-storage (2.29 ± 1.35) did not differ significantly from the control (2.12 ± 0.23). All samples responded similar to sieving and storage (r =0.68–0.73 for the correlation between Q10 in each respective treatment and Q10 in the control), with the exception ofsieved/dry-storage (r = 0.09). We conclude that sieving at field-moist conditions and subsequent freeze- or cold-storage is acceptable to derive SR and Q10 for the here reported storage time. Although dry-storage may be acceptable for the comparison ofSR between samples, it should be avoided for realistic estimates ofSR and for the determination ofQ10.},

  abstract = {A general framework is proposed that classifies existing bioturbation models according to two dividing lines: discrete/semi-discrete/continuous and local/nonlocal. Based on a common stochastic approach, which models biological reworking of particles as a position jump process, the relationships among the different model classes are exposed and the assumptions underlying each model are explicitly derived. We find that discrete/semi-discrete/continuous formulations are principally equivalent, leaving two basic modeling formalisms: (1) the more inclusive nonlocal exchange formalism and (2) the local biodiffusion model, which is obtained as a special case of the former. Three fundamental criteria determine the applicability of these formalisms, termed the frequency (a), symmetry (b), and length criterion (c). These criteria provide a quantitative basis to decide whether a process should be modeled as local (must comply to (a) + (b) + (c)) or nonlocal (must comply to (a) only). An order of magnitude assessment reveals that under natural conditions, most modes of sediment reworking meet the condition for the nonlocal exchange formalism, but violate the additional assumptions of the biodiffusion model, particularly for short-lived tracers. Nevertheless, in practice, the biodiffusion model has proven to be a valuable empirical model for sediment mixing. This apparent contradiction between theory and practice is termed the "biodiffusion paradox." Further exploration of the nonlocal formalism is encouraged to elucidate this paradox.},

  abstract = {DyDOC describes soil carbon dynamics, with a focus on dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The model treats the soil as a three-horizon profile, and simulates metabolic carbon transformations, sorption reactions and water transport. Humic substances are partitioned into three fractions, one of which is immobile, while the other two (hydrophilic and hydrophobic) can pass into solution as DOC. DyDOC requires site-specific soil characteristics, and is driven by inputs of litter and water, and air and soil temperatures. The model operates on hourly and daily time steps, and can simulate carbon cycling over both long (hundreds-to-thousands of years) and short (daily) time scales. An important feature of DyDOC is the tracking of 14C, from its entry in litter to its loss as DO14C in drainage water, enabling information about C dynamics to be obtained from both long-term radioactive decay, and the characteristic 14C pulse caused by thermonuclear weapon testing during the 1960s ("bomb carbon"). Parameterisation is performed by assuming a current steady state. Values of a range of variables, including C pools, annual DOC fluxes, and 14C signals, are combined into objective functions for least-squares minimisation. DyDOC has been applied successfully to spruce forest sites at Birkenes (Norway) and Waldstein (Germany), and most of the parameters have similar values at the two sites. The results indicate that the supply of DOC from the surface soil horizon to percolating water depends upon the continual metabolic production of easily leached humic material. In contrast, concentrations and fluxes of DOC in the deeper soil horizons are controlled by sorption processes, involving comparatively large pools of leachable organic matter. Times to reach steady stale are calculated to be several hundred years in the organic layer, and hundreds-to-thousands of years in the deeper mineral layers. It is estimated that DOC supplies 89\% of the mineral soil carbon at Birkenes, and 73\% at Waldstein. The model, parameterised with "steady state" data, simulates short-term variations in DOC concentrations and fluxes, and in DO 14C, which are in approximate agreement with observations.},

A moderately well drained Kennebec silt loam (Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Hapludoll) was sampled to a 10 cm depth. Soil under constant water content (CWC) was compared with soil subjected to a series of four dry–wet (DW) cycles during the experimental period (96 d) and incubated at 25 8C. Mineralized C and N were measured during the drying and rewetting periods. Aggregate size distributions were studied by separating the soil into four aggregate size classes (O2000, 250–2000, 53–250, and 20– 53 mm) by wet sieving. Repeated DW cycles significantly reduced cumulative N mineralization compared with CWC. The reduction in cumulative mineralized C resulting from DW compared with CWC increased as the DW treatments were subjected to additional cycles. The flush of mineralized C significantly decreased with repeated DW cycles. There was no significant effect on aggregate size distributions resulting from to the DW cycles compared with CWC treatment. Therefore, the flush of mineralized C and N seemed to be mostly microbial in origin in as much as aggregate distribution was unaffected by DW cycles.},

Measuring and monitoring soil carbon is complex because carbon pools cycle and rates of carbon sequestration vary across the landscape due to climate, soil type, and management practices. A new methodology has been developed and applied to make an assessment of the distribution of total, organic, and inorganic carbon at a grains research and grazing property in northern New South Wales at a high spatial resolution. In this study, baseline soil carbon maps were created using fine resolution, geo-referenced, proximal sensor data. Coupled with a digital elevation model and secondary terrain attributes, all of the data layers were combined by k-means clustering to develop a stratified random soil sampling scheme for the survey area. Soil samples taken at 0.15-m increments to a depth of 1m were scanned with a mid-infrared spectrometer, which was calibrated using a proportion of the samples that were analysed in a laboratory for total carbon and inorganic carbon content. This combination of new methodologies and technologies has the potential to provide large volumes of reliable, fine resolution and timely data required to make baseline assessments, mapping, monitoring, and verification possible. This method has the potential to make soil carbon management and trading at the farm-scale possible by quantifying the carbon stock to a depth of 1m and at a high spatial resolution.},

  abstract = {Mineral-associated organic matter (OM) represents a large reservoir of organic carbon (OC) in natural environments. The factors controlling the extent of the mineral-mediated OC stabilization, however, are poorly understood. The protection of OM against biodegradation upon sorption to mineral phases is assumed to result from the formation of strong bonds that limit desorption. To test this, we studied the biodegradation of OM bound to goethite (α-FeOOH), pyrophyllite, and vermiculite via specific mechanisms as estimated from OC uptake in different background electrolytes and operationally defined as 'ligand exchange', 'Ca2+ bridging', and 'van der Waals forces'. Organic matter extracted from an Oa forest floor horizon under Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) was reacted with minerals at dissolved OC concentrations of ∼5-130 mg/L at pH 4. Goethite retained up to 30.1 mg OC/g predominantly by 'ligand exchange'; pyrophyllite sorbed maximally 12.5 mg OC/g, largely via 'van der Waals forces' and 'Ca2+ bridging', while sorption of OM to vermiculite was 7.3 mg OC/g, mainly due to the formation of 'Ca2+ bridges'. Aromatic OM components were selectively sorbed by all minerals (goethite ≫ phyllosilicates). The sorption of OM was strongly hysteretic with the desorption into 0.01 M NaCl being larger for OM held by 'Ca2+ bridges' and 'van der Waals forces' than by 'ligand exchange'. Incubation experiments under aerobic conditions (initial pH 4; 90 days) revealed that OM mainly bound to minerals by 'ligand exchange' was more resistant against mineralization than OM held by non-columbic interactions ('van der Waals forces'). Calcium bridges enhanced the stability of sorbed OM, especially for vermiculite, but less than the binding via 'ligand exchange'. Combined evidence suggests that the extent and rate of mineralization of mineral-associated OM are governed by desorption. The intrinsic stability of sorbed OM as related to the presence of resistant, lignin-derived aromatic components appears less decisive for the sorptive stabilization of OM than the involved binding mechanisms. In a given environment, the type of minerals present and the solution chemistry determine the operating binding mechanisms, thereby the extent of OM sorption and desorption, and thus ultimately the bioavailability of mineral-associated OM. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Large portions of organic N (ON) in soil exist tightly associated with minerals. Mineral effects on the type of interactions, chemical composition, and stability of ON, however, are poorly understood. We investigated mineral-associated ON along a Hawaiian soil chronosequence (0.3-4100 kyr) formed in basaltic tephra under comparable climatic, topographic, and vegetation conditions. Mineral-organic associations were separated according to density (ρ {$>$} 1.6 g/cm3), characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption near edge fine structure (NEXAFS) and analyzed for amino acid enantiomers and amino sugars. The 14C activity of mineral-bound OC was estimated by accelerator mass spectrometry. The close OC-ON relationship (r = 0.96) and XPS results suggest that ON exists incorporated in bulk mineral-bound OM and likely becomes associated with minerals as part of sorbing OM. The youngest site (0.3 kyr), with soils mainly composed of primary minerals (olivine, pyroxene, feldspar) and with little ON, contained the largest proportion of hydrolyzable amino sugars and amino acids but with a small share of acidic amino acids (aspartic acid, glutamic acid). In soils of the intermediate weathering stage (20-400 kyr), where poorly crystalline minerals and metal(hydroxide)-organic precipitates prevail, more mineral-associated ON was present, containing a smaller proportion of hydrolyzable amino sugars and amino acids due to the preferential accumulation of other OM components such as lignin-derived phenols. Acidic amino acids were more abundant, reflecting the strong association of acidic organic components with metal(hydroxide)-organic precipitates and variable-charge minerals. In the final weathering stage (1400-4100 kyr) with well-crystalline secondary Fe and Al (hydr)oxides and kaolin minerals, mineral-organic associations held less ON and were, relative to lignin phenols, depleted in hydrolyzable amino sugars and amino acids, particularly in acidic amino acids. XPS and NEXAFS analyses showed that the majority (59-78\%) of the mineral-associated ON is peptide N while 18-34\% was aromatic N. Amino sugar ratios and d-alanine suggest that mineral-associated ON comprises a significant portion of bacterial residues, particularly in the subsoil. With increasing 14C age, a larger portion of peptide N was non-hydrolyzable, suggesting the accumulation of refractory compounds with time. The constant d/l ratios of lysine in topsoils indicate fresh proteinous material, likely due to continuous sorption of or exchange with fresh N-containing compounds. The 14C and the d/l signature revealed a longer turnover of proteinous components strongly bound to minerals (not NaOH-NaF-extractable). This study provides evidence that interactions with minerals are important in the transformation and stabilization of soil ON. Mineral-associated ON in topsoils seems actively involved in the N cycling of the study ecosystems, accentuating N limitation at the 0.3-kyr site but increasing N availability at older sites. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

For easy characterization of slowly cycling OM, treatments using oxidants such as sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) have been applied.

Here we compare biological mineralization of mineral-bound OM to its resistance to chemical oxidation by 6 mass\% NaOCl. Water-extractable OM, sorbed to goethite, vermiculite, and pyrophyllite at pH 4.0 and in different background electrolytes (CaCl2, NaCl, NaCl-NaH2PO4) to favor or exclude certain binding mechanisms, was subsequently subjected to NaOCl treatment (pH 7, either for 18 or 6 × 6 h). Irrespective of mineral surface properties and mechanisms involved in OM sorption, NaOCl removed a constant portion of the sorbed OC. More OC survived when bound to goethite than to vermiculite, thus confirming previous results on the increase of oxidation-resistant OC with increasing Fe and Al (hydr)oxide contents in different soils. Mineralizable OC (within 90 days) was much smaller than the NaOCl-removable OC and both fractions were negatively correlated (r2 = 0.90 for the 18 h treatment; r2 = 0.86 for the 6 × 6 h treatment), suggesting that chemically oxidizable OM does not represent the portion of sorbed OM available to biological consumption. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Recent concepts propose litter quality-controlled microbial assimilation and direct sorption processes as main factors in transferring carbon from plant litter into mineral-organic associations. We explored the pathways of the formation of mineral-associated organic matter (MOM) in soil profiles along a 120-ky ecosystem gradient that developed under humid climate from the retreating Franz Josef Glacier in New Zealand. We determined the stocks of particulate and mineral-associated carbon, the isotope signature and microbial decomposability of organic matter, and plant and microbial biomarkers (lignin phenols, amino sugars and acids) in MOM. Results revealed that litter quality had little effect on the accumulation of mineral-associated carbon and that plant-derived carbon bypassed microbial assimilation at all soil depths. Seemingly, MOM forms by sorption of microbial as well as plant-derived compounds to minerals. The MOM in carbon-saturated topsoil was characterized by the steady exchange of older for recent carbon, while subsoil MOM arises from retention of organic matter transported with percolating water. Overall, MOM formation is not monocausal but involves various mechanisms and processes, with reactive minerals being effective filters capable of erasing chemical differences in organic matter inputs.},

  abstract = {The variogram is important in pedometrics for describing and quantifying soil spatial variability. Therefore, it is essential to have a model that can describe various spatial processes and to use appropriate techniques for estimating its parameters. The Matérn model is a generalization of several theoretical variogram models that incorporates a smoothness parameter. We show the flexibility of the Matérn model using simulation and apply the Matérn model to some soil data in Australia. Parameters of the Matérn model were determined by restricted maximum likelihood (REML), and weighted nonlinear least-squares (WNLS) on the empirical variogram. The Matérn model is shown to be flexible and can be used to describe many isotropic spatial soil processes. The REML method fits the local spatial process correctly, however the drawback is the lengthy computation. Meanwhile WNLS fits only the shape of the calculated empirical variogram, and parameters estimated from WNLS can be misleading. From this study, the smoothness parameter of soil data from point measurement appears to be in the range of 0.25-0.50 and can be considered to be a rough spatial process. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) is a stratified random procedure that provides an efficient way of sampling variables from their multivariate distributions. It provides a full coverage of the range of each variable by maximally stratifying the marginal distribution. For conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) the problem is: given N sites with ancillary variables (X), select x a sub-sample of size n(n ≪ N) in order that x forms a Latin hypercube, or the multivariate distribution of X is maximally stratified. This paper presents the cLHS method with a search algorithm based on heuristic rules combined with an annealing schedule. The method is illustrated with a simple 3-D example and an application in digital soil mapping of part of the Hunter Valley of New South Wales, Australia. Comparison is made with other methods: random sampling, and equal spatial strata. The results show that the cLHS is the most effective way to replicate the distribution of the variables. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {There is a global demand for soil data and information for food security and global environmental management. There is also great interest in recognizing the soil system as a significant terrestrial sink of carbon. The reliable assessment of soil carbon (C) stocks is of key importance for soil conservation and in mitigation strategies for increased atmospheric carbon. In this article, we review and discuss the recent advances in digital mapping of soil C. The challenge to map carbon is demonstrated with the large variation of soil C concentration at a field, continental, and global scale. This article reviews recent studies in mapping soil C using digital soil mapping approaches. The general activities in digital soil mapping involve collection of a database of soil carbon observations over the area of interest; compilation of relevant covariates (scorpan factors) for the area; calibration or training of a spatial prediction function based on the observed dataset; interpolation and/or extrapolation of the prediction function over the whole area; and finally validation using existing or independent datasets. We discuss several relevant aspects in digital mapping: carbon concentration and carbon density, source of data, sampling density and resolution, depth of investigation, map validation, map uncertainty, and environmental covariates. We demonstrate harmonization of soil depths using the equal-area spline and the use of a material coordinate system to take into consideration the varying bulk density due to management practices. Soil C mapping has evolved from 2-D mapping of soil C stock at particular depth ranges to a semi-3-D soil map allowing the estimation of continuous soil C concentration or density with depth. This review then discusses the dynamics of soil C and the consequences for prediction and mapping of soil C change. Finally, we illustrate the prediction of soil carbon change using a semidynamic scorpan approach. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {The ???4 per mille Soils for Food Security and Climate??? was launched at the COP21 with an aspiration to increase global soil organic matter stocks by 4 per 1000 (or 0.4 \%) per year as a compensation for the global emissions of greenhouse gases by anthropogenic sources. This paper surveyed the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock estimates and sequestration potentials from 20 regions in the world (New Zealand, Chile, South Africa, Australia, Tanzania, Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, India, China Taiwan, South Korea, China Mainland, United States of America, France, Canada, Belgium, England \& Wales, Ireland, Scotland, and Russia). We asked whether the 4 per mille initiative is feasible for the region. The outcomes highlight region specific efforts and scopes for soil carbon sequestration. Reported soil C sequestration rates globally show that under best management practices, 4 per mille or even higher sequestration rates can be accomplished. High C sequestration rates (up to 10 per mille) can be achieved for soils with low initial SOC stock (topsoil less than 30 t C ha??? 1), and at the first twenty years after implementation of best management practices. In addition, areas which have reached equilibrium will not be able to further increase their sequestration. We found that most studies on SOC sequestration only consider topsoil (up to 0.3 m depth), as it is considered to be most affected by management techniques. The 4 per mille number was based on a blanket calculation of the whole global soil profile C stock, however the potential to increase SOC is mostly on managed agricultural lands. If we consider 4 per mille in the top 1m of global agricultural soils, SOC sequestration is between 2-3 Gt C year??? 1, which effectively offset 20???35\% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. As a strategy for climate change mitigation, soil carbon sequestration buys time over the next ten to twenty years while other effective sequestration and low carbon technologies become viable. The challenge for cropping farmers is to find disruptive technologies that will further improve soil condition and deliver increased soil carbon. Progress in 4 per mille requires collaboration and communication between scientists, farmers, policy makers, and marketeers.},

  abstract = {© 2017 British Society of Soil Science Soil water-holding capacity is an important component of the water and energy balances of the terrestrial biosphere. It controls the rate of evapotranspiration, and is a key to crop production. It is widely accepted that the available water capacity in soil can be improved by increasing organic matter content. However, the increase in amount of water that is available to plants with an increase in organic matter is still uncertain and may be overestimated. To clarify this issue, we carried out a meta-analysis from 60 published studies and analysed large databases (more than 50 000 measurements globally) to seek relations between organic carbon (OC) and water content at saturation, field capacity, wilting point and available water capacity. We show that the increase in organic carbon in soil has a small effect on soil water content. A 1\% mass increase in soil OC (or 10 g C kg −1 soil mineral), on average, increases water content at saturation, field capacity, wilting point and available water capacity by: 2.95, 1.61, 0.17 and 1.16 mm H 2 O 100 mm soil −1 , respectively. The increase is larger in sandy soils, followed by loams and is least in clays. Overall the increase in available water capacity is very small; 75\% of the studies reported had values between 0.7 and 2 mm 100 mm −1 with an increase of 10 g C kg −1 soil. Compared with reported annual rates of carbon sequestration after the adoption of conservation agricultural systems, the effect on soil available water is negligible. Thus, arguments for sequestering carbon to increase water storage are questionable. Conversely, global warming may cause losses in soil carbon, but the effects on soil water storage and its consequent impact on hydrological cycling might be less than thought previously. Highlights: We investigated how available water capacity can be increased with a 1\% increase in soil organic carbon. We analysed data from 60 published studies and global databases with more than 50 000 measurements. The increase in organic carbon in soil has a small effect on soil water retention. A 1\% mass increase in soil OC on average increased available water capacity by 1.16\%, volumetrically.},

These approaches were tested for the state of Indiana as a case study. A total of 464 pedons representing 204 soil series was obtained from the National Soil Survey Center database. Another 48 soil profile samples were collected to better represent the heterogeneity of the environmental variables. Two methods were used to model the depth distribution of the SOC stocks using negative exponential profile depth functions. In Procedure A, the functions to describe the depth distribution of volumetric C content for each soil profile were fitted using nonlinear least squares. In Procedure B, the exponential functions were fitted to describe the depth distribution of the cumulative SOC stocks. The parameters of the functions were interpolated for the entire study area using ordinary kriging on 81\% of the data points (n = 414). The integral of the exponential function up to the desired depth was used to predict SOC stocks within the 0- to 1-, 0- to 0.5-, and 0.5- to 1-m depth intervals. These estimates were validated using the remaining 19\% (n = 98) of the data. Procedure B showed a higher prediction accuracy for all depths, with higher rand lower RMSE values. The highest prediction accuracy (r = 0.75, RMSE = 2.89 kg m(-2)) was obtained for SOC stocks in the 0- to 0.5-m depth interval. Using Procedure B, SOC stocks within the top 1 m of Indiana soils were estimated to be 0.90 Pg C.},

  abstract = {From 1999 to 2002, the variations in carbon flux due to management practices (shrub removal, thinning) and climate variability were observed in a young ponderosa pine forest originated from clear-cutting and plantation in 1990. These measurements were done at the Blodgett Forest Ameriflux site located in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. Thinning in spring 2000 decreased the leaf area index (LAI) by 34\% and added 496 g C m-2 of wood and leaf debris at the soil surface. Total ecosystem respiration was not significantly affected by thinning (1261 g C m-2 in 1999 and 1273 g C m-2 in 2000), while canopy photosynthesis decreased by 202 g C m-2. As a result the ecosystem shifted from a net sink of CO 2 in 1999 (-201 g C m-2) to a small net source in 2000 (13 g C m-2). Woody and leaf debris resulting from thinning only accounted for maximum 1\% and 7\% of the total respiration flux, respectively. Thinning did not affect the relative proportion of the different components of respiration to an observable degree. Low soil water availability in summer 2001 and 2002 decreased the proportion of soil respiration to the total respiration. It also imposed limitations on canopy photosynthesis: as a result the ecosystem shifted from a sink to a source of carbon 1 month earlier than in a wetter year (1999). The leaf area index and biomass of the stand increased rapidly after the thinning. The ecosystem was again a sink of carbon in 2001 (-97 g C m -2) and 2002 (-172 g C m-2). The net carbon uptake outside the traditionally-defined growing season can be important in this ecosystem (NEE = -50 g C m-2 in 2000), but interannual variations are significant due to differences in winter temperatures. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {© 2014 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd. Reforestation of formerly cultivated land is widely understood to accumulate above- and belowground detrital organic matter pools, including soil organic matter. However, during 40 years of study of reforestation in the subtropical southeast ern USA, repeated observations of above- and belowground carbon documented that significant gains in soil organic matter (SOM) in surface soils (0-7.5 cm) were offset by significant SOM losses in subsoils (35-60 cm). Here, we extended the observation period in this long-term experiment by an additional decade, and used soil fractionation and stable isotopes and radioisotopes to explore changes in soil organic carbon and soil nitrogen that accompanied nearly 50 years of loblolly pine secondary forest development. We observed that accumulations of mineral soil C and N from 0 to 7.5 cm were almost entirely due to accumulations of light-fraction SOM. Meanwhile, losses of soil C and N from mineral soils at 35 to 60 cm were from SOM associated with silt and clay-sized particles. Isotopic signatures showed relatively large accumulations of forest-derived carbon in surface soils, and little to no accumulation of forest-derived carbon in subsoils. We argue that the land use change from old field to secondary forest drove biogeochemical and hydrological changes throughout the soil profile that enhanced microbial activity and SOM decomposition in subsoils. However, when the pine stands aged and began to transition to mixed pines and hardwoods, demands on soil organic matter for nutrients to support aboveground growth eased due to pine mortality, and subsoil organic matter levels stabilized. This study emphasizes the importance of long-term experiments and deep measurements when characterizing soil C and N responses to land use change and the remarkable paucity of such long-term soil data deeper than 30 cm.},

Twenty-five soil properties were measured, including standard chemical soil tests, aggregate stability (WSA), bulk density (rho(b)) penetration resistance (PR), saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s), infiltrability (Infilt), several porosity indicators (aeration pores(PO {$>$} 1000), soil water potential = Psi {$>$} -0.36 kPa; air-filled pores at field capacity (PO {$>$} 30), Psi {$>$} -10kPa; available water capacity (AWC), -1500 {$<$} Psi {$<$} -10 kPa), total organic matter (OM), parasitic (Nem(Parasitic)) and beneficial nematode (Nem(Beneficial)) populations, decomposition rate (Decomp), potentially mineralizable N (PMN) and easily extractable (EEG) and total glomalin (TG). Only eight indicators were adversely affected by stover harvest, and most of these effects were significant only under NT Almost all indicators affected by stover removal were affected equally or more adversely by tillage. A total of 15 indicators were adversely affected by tillage. Results of this study suggest that, on a silt loam soil in a temperate climate, long-term stover harvest had lower adverse impacts on soil quality than long-term tillage. Stover harvest appears to be sustainable when practiced under NT management.},

There is a growing concern land‐use change (LUC) to cropland will result in a loss of ecosystem function and various ecosystem services essential for human health and well‐being. This paper examines projections of future cropland expansion from an integrated assessment model IMAGE 3.0 under a “business as usual” scenario and the direct impact on both biodiversity and C storage. By focusing on biodiversity hotspots and Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE) sites, loss of habitat as well as potential impacts on endan- gered and critically endangered species are explored. With regards to C storage, the impact on both soil and vegetation standing C stocks are examined. We show that if projected trends are realized, there are likely to be severe consequences for these resources. Substantial loss of habitat in biodiversity hotspots such as Indo‐Burma, and the Philippians is expected as well as 50\% of species in AZE sites losing part of their last remaining habitat. An estimated 13.7\% of vegetation standing C stocks and 4.6\% of soil C stocks are also projected to be lost in areas affected with Brazil and Mexico being identified as priorities in terms of both biodiversity and C losses from cropland expansion. Changes in policy to regulate projected cropland expan- sion, and increased measures to protect natural resources, are highly likely to be required to prevent these biodiversity and C losses in the future.},

The main emphasis is on the approaches used to study these mechanisms and the factors that affect the aggregating mechanisms at the micro-scale ({$<$}100 µm) level in soils. Much of the understanding of the stabilisation of soil into macro-aggregates in field soils by labile organic C is derived primarily from the interpretations of studies where soils were incubated under artificial conditions. In addition, many recent studies have assessed the importance of labile organic C in macro-aggregation based only on whole soils analyses of hyphal length, extractable carbohydrate C, microbial biomass C, or aliphatic C. These approaches have contributed little to understanding fundamental factors that can influence the biological mechanisms of macro-aggregation under field conditions. It is proposed that greater consideration of bonding and binding aggregation mechanisms and the factors affecting the mechanisms at the micro-scale level will facilitate development of field management practices that benefit macro-aggregation. Factors influencing the location and persistence of bonding and binding mechanisms in the soil matrix are discussed.},

A challenge to farmer uptake is high spatial and temporal variability in cover crop growth and performance. Since topography plays an important role in spatial processes that ultimately affect plant performance, it could be used to quantify cover crop spatial variability and cover crop contribution to a subsequent cash crop. We assessed the effects of topography and cover crop (red clover) biomass on corn yields. Hierarchical path analysis was used to identify direct and indirect relationships among topography, red clover biomass, and corn yield, while taking into account the effects of agricultural management practices, multiple years, and multiple experimental fields. We observed that topography contribute significantly to explaining the variability in both red clover biomass and corn yields. Higher red clover biomass was produced in flat areas, whereas higher corn yield was produced in areas with high curvature. Red clover biomass positively influenced corn yield, however, the magnitude of that effect varied both temporally and spatially. The effect of red clover on corn yields was significant only in the years with lowest precipitation; and its magnitude was more pronounced at summit and slope topographical positions. Therefore, a good cover crop stand will be most beneficial to subsequent corn crop at summit and slope positions. Accounting for variability in fields and years using a hierarchical model significantly improved analysis of the interactive relationships between topography, red clover, and corn; therefore we encouraged its use in agroecological research. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

In the present study we used particle size SOM fractions (sand, silt and clay), derived from the Ah soil horizon from a Norway spruce forest in Southern Germany, to study the effects of different stabilization mechanisms on the bioavailability of soil organic carbon (SOC) in a one year incubation experiment. The respired CO2 was hourly recorded, additionally 13CO2 was analysed 20 times and 14CO2 three times during the incubation experiment. To better differentiate between particulate OM (POM) and mineral associated OM (MIN), the incubated fractions and bulk soil were separated according to density (1.8gcm-3) after the incubation experiment. 13C-CPMAS NMR spectroscopy was used to study the chemical composition of the incubated samples. We demonstrate a clear increase in SOM bioavailability due to aggregate disruption, as the calculated theoretical CO2 evolution of the SOM fractions recombined by calculation was 43.8\% higher in relation to the intact bulk soil. The incubated sand fraction, dominated by POM rich in O/N-alkyl C, showed a prolonged bioavailability of SOC moieties with mean residence times (MRT) of 78 years. Interestingly, the silt fraction, dominated by highly aliphatic, more recalcitrant POM, showed low mineralization rates and slow MRT's (192 years) close to values for the clay fraction (171 years), which contained a large amount of mineral-associated SOM. The recorded 13/12CO2 signatures showed a high depletion in 13C during the initial stage of the incubation, but an enrichment of the respired 13CO2 of up to 3.4‰ relative to the incubated SOM was observed over longer time periods (after 3 and 4 days for bulk soil and sand, respectively, and after 14 days for silt and clay). Therefore, we found no evidence for a 13C enrichment of SOM as driven by metabolic isotopic fractionation during microbial SOM mineralization, but an indication of a change in the isotopic composition of the C-source over time. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Although the ways to quantify soil OC and to study connected C dynamics from ecosystem to global scale in the Arctic has improved substantially over the last years, the basic mechanisms of OC sequestration are still not well understood. Here we demonstrate a first approach to directly study micro scale soil structures mainly responsible for soil OC (SOC) stabilization using nano scale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS). A cross section from a permafrost layer of a Cryosol from Northern Alaska was analysed using a cascade of imaging techniques from reflectance light microscopy (RLM) to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to NanoSIMS. This allowed for the direct evaluation of micro scale soil structures known to be hot spots for microbial activity and SOC stabilization in temperate soils. The imaging techniques were supported by classical soil analyses. Using this unique set of techniques we are able to evidence the formation of micro-aggregate structures in the vicinity of plant residues in permafrost soils. This clearly indicates biogeochemical interfaces at plant surfaces as important spheres for the formation of more complex soil structures in permafrost soils. Organo-mineral associations from these hot spots of microbial activity were recovered from plant residues (free particulate organic matter, fPOM) as fine grained mineral fraction with a typically low C/N ratio. This nicely illustrates the link between classical bulk analysis and state of the art spectromicroscopic techniques.},

  abstract = {This experiment investigated the effects of prolonged summer drought on soil respiration (SR) in a mountainous Norway spruce forest in south Germany. On three manipulation plots we excluded summer throughfall in the years of 2006/2007 and measured SR fluxes in comparison to three control plots. Using radiocarbon measurements we quantified the contribution of rhizosphere (RR) and heterotrophic respiration (HR) to total SR. In both manipulation years, mean CO2 emissions (Â±SE) from the throughfall exclusion (TE) plots were smaller than from the control plots with 5.7 t C haâˆ'1 (Â±0.3) compared to 6.7 t C haâˆ'1 (Â±0.2) in 2006 and 5.9 t C haâˆ'1 (Â±0.3) compared to 7.0 t C haâˆ'1 (Â±0.4) in 2007. Under control conditions, CO2 originated mainly from HR (60â€“95\% of SR). Prolonged drought reduced HR, whereas RR was not affected or even increased slightly. Reduction of CO2 emissions on the TE plots was found up to 6 weeks after differences in matric potential conditions disappeared, possibly either because water repellency inhibited homogeneous rewetting of the organic horizons or because of severe damage to the microbial population. No evidence was found for the release of new, formerly protected substrates by preceding drought. Continuous measurements in 2008 (no manipulation) did not reveal increased CO2 emissions on the TE plots that could compensate for the reduction during the years 2006/2007. Based on our results, we postulate a negative feedback between increased frequency and magnitude of summer droughts and SR in Norway spruce stands.},

  abstract = {Apart from a general increase of mean annual air temperature, climate models predict a regional increase of the frequency and intensity of soil frost with possibly strong effects on C cycling of soils. In this study, we induced mild soil frost (up to -5 degrees C in a depth of 5 cm below surface) in a Norway spruce forest soil by removing the natural snow cover in the winter of 2005/2006. Soil frost lasted from January to April 2006 and was detected down to 15 cm depth. Soil frost effectively reduced soil respiration in the snow removal plots in comparison to undisturbed control plots. On an annual basis 6.2 t C ha(-1) a(-1) were emitted in the control plots compared with 5.1 t C ha(-1) a(-1) in the snow removal plots. Only 14\% of this difference was attributed to reduced soil respiration during the soil frost period itself, whereas 63\% of this difference originated from differences during the summer of 2006. Radiocarbon (Delta C-14) signature of CO2 revealed a considerable reduction of heterotrophic respiration on the snow removal plots, only partly compensated for by a slight increase of rhizosphere respiration. Similar CO2 concentrations in the uppermost mineral horizons of both treatments indicate that differences between the treatments originated from the organic horizons. Extremely low water contents between June and October of 2006 may have inhibited the recovery of the heterotrophic organisms from the frost period, thereby enhancing the differences between the control and snow removal plots. We conclude that soil frost triggered a change in the composition of the microbial community, leading to an increased sensitivity of heterotrophic respiration to summer drought. A CO2 pulse during thawing, such as described for arable soils several times throughout the literature, with the potential to partly compensate for reduced soil respiration during soil frost, appears to be lacking for this soil. Our results from this experiment indicate that soil frost reduces C emission from forest soils, whereas mild winters may enhance C losses from forest soils.},

  abstract = {Periods of prolonged summer drought are likely to be expected for this century, with possibly strong effects on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) mineralization in soils. Drought generally reduces mineralization rates, but the possibility of excess mineralization pulses during rewetting raises the question about the net effect of drying-rewetting events. In this experiment, we measured C and N mineralization in undisturbed soil columns that were either kept under continuously moist conditions (control) or that were subjected to drying-rewetting. We had three treatments (D1-D3) with different drying intensity (increasing from D1 to D3) but uniform rewetting intensity (4 mm d-1). Soil columns were taken from a Norway spruce forest in Bavaria, Germany. The CO2 fluxes from control and treatment groups were identical before drying. Over the 80 d drought period, total CO2 emissions from D1, D2, and D3 were only 72, 52 and 43\% of that from the control, respectively. Rewetting resulted in a fast increase of CO2 fluxes to approx. the same level as in the control. Rewetting could not restore soil moisture of the dry soil to the level of the control, presumably because of preferential flow and water repellency of soil organic matter. No significant excess C mineralization during the 40 d rewetting period was observed. Adding up total CO2 fluxes during drought and rewetting period, the treatments D1, D2, and D3 emitted only 88, 71 and 67\% of the CO2 emitted by the control. Measurements of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) did only show minor differences between control and treatment columns, indicating that no significant accumulation of DOC took place during the drought period. Radiocarbon signature of emitted CO2 indicated that C mineralization was reduced with decreasing water availability and no new substrate became bioavailable. Net N mineralization over the course of the whole experiment was reduced by drought to 77, 65 or 52\% of the control. Net nitrification was virtually zero during drought whereas net ammonification continued at reduced levels. In summary, we found that drying-rewetting generally reduced C and N mineralization in this soil and that the total reduction increased with drought intensity. ?? 2010.},

In a Free Air CO 2 Enrichment Experiment at the alpine treeline, we estimated the contribution of 13 C-depleted recent plant C to DOC of mor-type organic layers. In an additional laboratory soil column study with 40 leaching cycles, we traced the fate of 13 C-labelled litter-DOC (22 and 45 mg l -1 ) in intact Oa horizons at 2 and 15 °C. Results of the field study showed that DOC in the Oa horizon at 5 cm depth contained only 20 ± 3\% of less than six-year-old C, indicating minor contributions of throughfall, root exudates, and fresh litter to leached DOC. In the soil column experiment, there was a sustained DOC leaching from native soil organic matter. Less than 10\% of totally added litter-DOC was leached despite a rapid breakthrough of a bromide tracer (50 ± 7\% within two days). Biodegradation contributed only partly to the DOC removal with 18-30\% of added litter-DOC being mineralized in the Oa horizons at 2 and 15 °C, respectively. This was substantially less than the potential 70\%-biodegradability of the litter-DOC itself, which indicates a stabilization of litter-DOC in the Oa horizon. In summary, our results give evidence on an apparent 'exchange' of DOC in thick organic layers with litter-DOC being retained and 'replaced' by 'older' DOC leached from the large pool of indigenous soil organic matter. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study quantifies this plant-derived C incorporation into abiotic and biotic C pools in top- and subsoil in an arable field over five years. Stable isotope analysis was used to determine the incorporation of maize root and shoot litter C into soil organic C (SOC), extractable organic C (EOC), total microbial biomass (Cmic), ergosterol and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). The following treatments were investigated: corn maize (CM), providing root- and shoot-derived C (without corncobs), fodder maize (FM), providing only root-derived C, and wheat plus maize shoot litter amendment (WL), providing only shoot-derived maize C. Wheat plants (W) without maize litter amendment served as control. Soil samples were taken each September directly before harvest from 2009 to 2013. During the experiment, the maize-derived C signal increased in SOC, EOC, Cmic, ergosterol, bacterial and fungal PLFAs in the topsoil (0-10 cm). Although total maize shoot C input was threefold lower than maize root C input, similar relative amounts of maize C derived from shoots and roots were incorporated into the different C pools in the WL and the FM treatments, indicating the importance of shoot-derived C sources for microorganisms in the topsoil. An additive effect of both C sources was found in the CM treatment with almost twice as much maize-derived C in the respective pools. Furthermore, the proportion of maize-derived C varied between the different pools with lower incorporation into the total SOC (17\%) and total EOC (24\%) pools and higher incorporation ratios of maize C into PLFAs of different microbial groups (29\% in Gram-positive (Gr+) bacterial PLFA-C, 44\% in Gram-negative (Gr-) bacterial PLFA-C, 69\% in fungal PLFA-C and 78\% in ergosterol) in the CM treatment in topsoil after five years. After the third and fifth vegetation periods, we also detected maize-derived C in the rooted zone (40-50 cm depth) and the root-free zone (60-70 cm depth). The maize-derived C incorporation was lower in subsoil C pools in comparison to topsoil C pools. In the root-free zone, the maize-derived C was found to be 2\% in total SOC, 28\% in total EOC, 9\% in Gr+bacterial PLFA-C, 20\% in Gr-bacterial PLFA-C and 53\% in fungal PLFA-C. Saprotrophic fungi incorporated maize-derived C in all soil depths to a greater degree than Gr+and Gr-bacteria, indicating the importance of saprotrophic fungi in this agro-ecosystem.},

These fertilizers have been managed as a cost-effective form of insurance against low yields, without regard to the inherent effect of mineral N in promoting microbial C utilization. Such an effect is consistent with a net loss of soil organic C recently observed for the Morrow Plots, America's oldest experiment field, after 40 to 50 yr of synthetic N fertilization that substantially exceeded grain N removal. A similar decline in total soil N is reported herein for the same site and would be expected from the predominantly organic occurrence of soil N. This decline is in agreement with numerous long-term baseline data sets from chemical-based cropping systems involving a wide variety of soils, geographic regions, and tillage practices. The loss of organic N decreases soil productivity and the agronomic efficiency (kg grain kg(-1) N) of fertilizer N and has been implicated in widespread reports of yield stagnation or even decline for grain production in Asia. A major global evaluation of current cereal production systems should be undertaken, with a view toward using scientific and technological advances to increase input efficiencies. As one aspect of this strategy, the input of ammoniacal N should be more accurately matched to crop N requirement. Long-term sustainability may require agricultural diversification involving a gradual transition from intensive synthetic N inputs to legume-based crop rotations.},

  abstract = {Species data held in museum and herbaria, survey data and opportunistically observed data are a substantial information resource. A key challenge in using these data is the uncertainty about where an observation is located. This is important when the data are used for species distribution modelling (SDM), because the coordinates are used to extract the environmental variables and thus, positional error may lead to inaccurate estimation of the species–environment relationship. The magnitude of this effect is related to the level of spatial autocorrelation in the environmental variables. Using local spatial association can be relevant because it can lead to the identification of the specific occurrence records that cause the largest drop in SDM accuracy. Therefore, in this study, we tested whether the SDM predictions are more affected by positional uncertainty originating from locations that have lower local spatial association in their predictors. We performed this experiment for Spain and the Netherlands, using simulated datasets derived from well known species distribution models (SDMs). We used the K statistic to quantify the local spatial association in the predictors at each species occurrence location. A probabilistic approach using Monte Carlo simulations was employed to introduce the error in the species locations. The results revealed that positional uncertainty in species occurrence data at locations with low local spatial association in predictors reduced the prediction accuracy of the SDMs. We propose that local spatial association is a way to identify the species occurrence records that require treatment for positional uncertainty. We also developed and present a tool in the R environment to target observations that are likely to create error in the output from SDMs as a result of positional uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Although considerable research has been conducted on the importance of recent litter compared with older soil organic matter as sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in forest soils, a more thorough evaluation of this mechanism is necessary. We studied water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC) in a soil profile under a cool-temperate beech forest by analysing the isotopic composition (13Cand 14C) of WEOC and its fractions after separation on a DAX-8 resin. With depth, WEOC became more enriched in 13C, which reflects the increasing proportion of the hydrophilic, isotopically heavier fraction. The 14C content in WEOC and its fractions decreased with depth, paralleling the 14C trend in soil organic matter (SOM). These results indicate a dynamic equilibrium of WEOC and soil organic carbon. The dominant process maintaining the WEOC pool in the mineral soil appears to be the microbial release of water-soluble compounds from the SOM, which alters in time-scales of decades to centuries.},

  abstract = {The formation of soil organo-mineral complexes is a key reaction in the carbon cycle in soil, since organic materials acquire a resistance to decomposition due to the formation of the complexes. Adsorption of dissolved organic matter (DOM) onto soil minerals provides a model of this important process. Adsorption of DOM onto samples from Andisols, Inceptisols, and Entisols in batch experiments was compared in terms of the quantitative relationship between the soil properties and the adsorption behavior of DOM. Adsorption behavior was effectively described by a linear initial mass (IM) isotherm, indicating that the adsorption efficiency did not appreciably decline in the range studied even though a large amount of DOM was applied to the soil samples. Samples from Andisols showed a particularly high efficiency of adsorption compared with those from other soils which contained a comparable amount of organic carbon. Explanatory variables useful to predict the efficiency parameter were investigated in 2 steps: firstly the degree of carbon accumulation in the soil samples was examined, and next an index for the amount of ligand exchange sites was examined in combination with the former indices. As a result, an index comprising the total carbon/clay (or total carbon/specific surface area) ratio and the amount of hydroxy ions in the soil extracts with NaF solution was eventually detected. The former represents the degree of carbon occupation on the soil surface, and the latter the amount of ligand exchange sites on labile aluminum. Although the mechanisms involved in the adsorption varied among soils, the selected index was significantly correlated with the adsorption efficiency.},

  abstract = {The carbon (C) storage capacity of northern latitude ecosystems may diminish as warming air temperatures increase permafrost thaw and stimulate decomposition of previously frozen soil organic C. However, warming may also enhance plant growth so that photosynthetic carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake may, in part, offset respiratory losses. To determine the effects of air and soil warming on CO2 exchange in tundra, we established an ecosystem warming experiment – the Carbon in Permafrost Experimental Heating Research (CiPEHR) project – in the northern foothills of the Alaska Range in Interior Alaska. We used snow fences coupled with spring snow removal to increase deep soil temperatures and thaw depth (winter warming) and open-top chambers to increase growing season air temperatures (summer warming).Winter warming increased soil temperature (integrated 5–40cm depth) by 1.5 1C, which resulted in a 10\% increase in growing season thaw depth. Surprisingly, the additional 2kg of thawed soil Cm2 in the winter warming plots did not result in significant changes in cumulative growing season respiration, which may have been inhibited by soil saturation at the base of the active layer. In contrast to the limited effects on growing-season C dynamics, winter warming caused drastic changes in winter respiration and altered the annual C balance of this ecosystem by doubling the net loss of CO2 to the atmosphere. While most changes to the abiotic environment at CiPEHR were driven by winter warming, summer warming effects on plant and soil processes resulted in 20\% increases in both gross primary productivity and growing season ecosystem respiration and significantly altered the age and sources of CO2 respired from this ecosystem. These results demonstrate the vulnerability of organic C stored in near surface permafrost to increasing temperatures and the strong potential for warming tundra t},

  abstract = {Forest soil carbon (C) storage is a significant component of the global C cycle, and is important for sustaining forest productivity. Although forest management may have substantial impacts on soil C storage, experimental data from forest harvesting studies have not been synthesized recently. To quantify the effects of harvesting on soil C, and to identify sources of variation in soil C responses to harvest, we used meta-analysis to test a database of 432 soil C response ratios drawn from temperate forest harvest studies around the world. Harvesting reduced soil C by an average of 8 ± 3\% (95\% CI), although numerous sources of variation mediated this significant, overall effect. In particular, we found that C concentrations and C pool sizes responded differently to harvesting, and forest floors were more likely to lose C than mineral soils. Harvesting caused forest floor C storage to decline by a remarkably consistent 30 ± 6\%, but losses were significantly smaller in coniferous/mixed stands (-20\%) than hardwoods (-36\%). Mineral soils showed no significant, overall change in C storage due to harvest, and variation among mineral soils was best explained by soil taxonomy. Alfisols and Spodosols exhibited no significant changes, and Inceptisols and Ultisols lost mineral soil C (-13\% and -7\%, respectively). However, these C losses were neither permanent nor unavoidable. Controls on variation within orders were not consistent, but included species composition, time, and sampling depth. Temporal patterns and soil C budgets suggest that forest floor C losses probably have a lesser impact on total soil C storage on Alfisols, Inceptisols, and Ultisols than on Spodosols, which store proportionately large amounts of C in forest floors with long C recovery times (50-70 years). Mineral soil C losses on Inceptisols and Ultisols indicate that these orders are vulnerable to significant harvest-induced changes in total soil C storage, but alternative residue management and site preparation techniques, and the passage of time, may mitigate or negate these losses. Key findings of this analysis, including the dependence of forest floor and mineral soil C storage changes on species composition and soil taxonomic order, suggest that further primary research may make it possible to create predictive maps of forest harvesting effects on soil C storage. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The movement of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) through soils is an important process for the transport of carbon within ecosystems and the formation of soil organic matter. In some cases, DOC fluxes may also contribute to the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems; in most ecosystems, they are an important source of energy, carbon, and nutrient transfers from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems. Despite their importance for terrestrial and aquatic biogeochemistry, these fluxes are rarely represented in conceptual or numerical models of terrestrial biogeochemistry. In part, this is due to the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the suite of processes that control DOC dynamics in soils. In this article, we synthesize information on the geochemical and biological factors that control DOC fluxes through soils. We focus on conceptual issues and quantitative evaluations of key process rates to present a general numerical model of DOC dynamics. We then test the sensitivity of the model to variation in the controlling parameters to highlight both the significance of DOC fluxes to terrestrial carbon processes and the key uncertainties that require additional experiments and data. Simulation model results indicate the importance of representing both root carbon inputs and soluble carbon fluxes to predict the quantity and distribution of soil carbon in soil layers. For a test case in a temperate forest, DOC contributed 25\% of the total soil profile carbon, whereas roots provided the remainder. The analysis also shows that physical factors - most notably, sorption dynamics and hydrology - play the dominant role in regulating DOC losses from terrestrial ecosystems but that interactions between hydrology and microbial-DOC relationships are important in regulating the fluxes of DOC in the litter and surface soil horizons. The model also indicates that DOC fluxes to deeper soil layers can support a large fraction (up to 30\%) of microbial activity below 40 cm.},

To structure our review, we employ the framework ofsequential stages in the innovation process, with which we code each NETs article in innovation space. We find that while there is a growing body of innovation literature on NETs, 59\% of the articles are focused on the earliest stages of the innovation process, ‘research and development' (R\&D). The subsequent stages of innovation are also represented in the literature, but at much lower levels ofactivity than R\&D. Distinguishing between innovation stages that are related to the supply of the technology (R\&D, demonstrations, scale up) and demand for the technology (demand pull, niche markets, public acceptance), we find an overwhelming emphasis (83\%) on the supply side. BECCS articles have an above average share ofdemand-side articles while direct air carbon capture and storage has a very low share. Innovation in NETs has much to learn from successfully diffused technologies; appealing to heterogeneous users, managing policy risk, as well as understanding and addressing public concerns are all crucial yet not well represented in the extant literature. Results from integrated assessment models show that while NETs play a key role in the second halfof the 21st century for 1.5 ◦Cand 2 ◦C scenarios, the major period ofnew NETs deployment is between 2030 and 2050. Given that the broader innovation literature consistently finds long time periods involved in scaling up and deploying novel technologies, there is an urgency to developing NETs that is largely unappreciated. This challenge is exacerbated by the thousands to millions of actors that potentially need to adopt these technologies for them to achieve planetary scale. This urgency is reflected neither in the Paris Agreement nor in most of the literature we review here. IfNETs are to be deployed at the levels required to meet 1.5 ◦Cand 2 ◦C targets, then important post-R\&D issues will need to be addressed in the literature, including incentives for early deployment, niche markets, scale-up, demand, and—particularly ifdeployment is to be hastened—public acceptance.},

Mineral bags contained quartz, ferrihydrite, kaolinite, or soil minerals isolated via density separation. Using13C-nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, and lipidomics, we traced carbon deposition onto minerals, characterizing total carbon,13C enrichment, and SOM chemistry over three growth stages ofAvena barbata. Carbon accumulation was rapid and mineral-dependent but slowed with time; the accumulated amount was not significantly affected by root presence. However, plant roots strongly shaped the chemistry of mineral-associated SOM. Minerals incubated in a plant rhizosphere were associated with a more diverse array of compounds (with different functional groups—carbonyl, aromatics, carbohydrates, and lipids) than minerals incubated in an unplanted bulk soil control. We also found that many of the lipids that sorbed to minerals were microbially derived, including many fungal lipids. Together, our data suggest that diverse rhizosphere-derived compounds may represent a transient fraction of mineral SOM, rapidly exchanging with mineral surfaces.},

Here we report the use of force spectroscopy to directly measure the binding between organic ligands with known chemical functionalities and soil minerals in aqueous environments. By systematically studying the role of organic functional group chemistry with model minerals, we demonstrate that chemistry of both the organic ligand and mineral contribute to values of binding free energy and that changes in pH and ionic strength produce significant differences in binding energies.

Precipitation of DOM-Al appeared to be strongly correlated with M/C ratio and the pH.

  abstract = {With an increasing fraction of the world's forests being intensively managed for meeting humanity's need for wood, fiber and ecosystem services, quantitative understanding of the functional changes in these ecosystems in comparison with natural forests is needed. In particular, the role of managed forests as long-term carbon (C) sinks and for mitigating climate change require a detailed assessment of their carbon cycle on different temporal scales. In the current review we assess available data on the structure and function of the world's forests, explore the main differences in the C exchange between managed and unmanaged stands, and explore potential physiological mechanisms behind both observed and expected changes. Two global databases that include classification for management indicate that managed forests are about 50. years younger, include 25\% more coniferous stands, and have about 50\% lower C stocks than unmanaged forests. The gross primary productivity (GPP) and total net primary productivity (NPP) are the similar, but relatively more of the assimilated carbon is allocated to aboveground pools in managed than in unmanaged forests, whereas allocation to fine roots and rhizosymbionts is lower. This shift in allocation patterns is promoted by increasing plant size, and by increased nutrient availability. Long-term carbon sequestration potential in soils is assessed through the ratio of heterotrophic respiration to total detritus production, which indicates that (i) the forest soils may be losing more carbon on an annual basis than they regain in detritus, and (ii) the deficit appears to be greater in managed forests. While climate change and management factors (esp. fertilization) both contribute to greater carbon accumulation potential in the soil, the harvest-related increase in decomposition affects the C budget over the entire harvest cycle. Although the findings do not preclude the use of forests for climate mitigation, maximizing merchantable productivity may have significant carbon costs for the soil pool. We conclude that optimal management strategies for maximizing multiple benefits from ecosystem services require better understanding of the dynamics of belowground allocation, carbohydrate availability, heterotrophic respiration, and carbon stabilization in the soil.},

We applied a novel graphical method for tracking changes in δ\textsuperscript{13}C and \textsuperscript{14}C of DIC in two distinct aquifer complexes identified in the Hainich Critical Zone Exploratory (CZE), a platform to study how water transport links surface and shallow groundwaters in limestone and marlstone rocks in central Germany.

Carbon isotopes and chemical changes in the deeper HTL wells could be explained by interaction of recharge waters equilibrated with post-bomb \textsuperscript{14}C sources with carbonates. However, oxygen depletion and δ\textsuperscript{13}C and \textsuperscript{14}C values of DIC below those expected from the processes of carbonate equilibrium alone indicate dramatically different biogeochemical evolution of waters in the upper aquifer assemblage (HTU wells). Changes of \textsuperscript{14}C and \textsuperscript{13}C in the upper aquifer complexes result from a number of biotic and abiotic processes, including oxidation of \textsuperscript{14}C depleted OM derived from recycled microbial carbon and sedimentary organic matter as well as water rock interactions.

These measurements of carbon (C) turnover are frequently made in the laboratory where it is easier to control the experimental conditions. However, this could potentially bias the results due to a range of factors including the absence of plants and associated mycorrhizas, physical disturbance, alteration in redox status etc. The aim of this study was therefore to directly compare the turnover of organic acids under field and laboratory conditions in three contrasting land use regimes (grassland, woodland and arable). The method involved the injection of 14C-labeled citric acid into the top soil and monitoring of its mineralization by capturing 14CO2 evolved from the soil over a 7 day period. Laboratory climate conditions were matched to those in the field. In both the laboratory and the field we showed that 14CO2 evolution followed a bi-phasic pattern and conformed extremely well to a double first-order kinetic model. While the first rapid mineralization phase showed a similar half-life for citrate under both laboratory and field conditions (4.9 ± 0.7 h), the second slower mineralization phase had a significantly longer half-life when performed in the field. Overall, our results suggest that the first rapid mineralization phase was largely independent of our experimental conditions whilst the turnover of the citrate-derived C immobilized in the microbial biomass was significantly affected by the incubation conditions either due to differences in substrate utilization and storage pathways or due to faster microbial turnover in the laboratory. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This is a serious issue after many publications and reports during the last two decades have recommended no-till as a practice to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions through soil C sequestration. Our objective was to investigate the possibility that the lack of C increase in some no-till systems may be due to changes in crop productivity and subsequent C input to soils. A meta-analysis of 74 published studies was conducted to determine if crop production varies between no-till and full tillage management. The results were used to estimate the change in C input due to no-till adoption and the influence on soil organic C stocks at steady-state using the Century model. We found that crop productivity can be reduced with adoption of no-till, particularly in cooler and/or wetter climatic conditions. The influence varies, however, and crop productivity can even increase in some regions following adoption of no-till. In cases where crop production and C inputs decreased due to no-till, the potential reduction in soil organic C stocks was offset by a decrease in soil C decomposition rates, except in cases where C inputs declined by 15\% or more. Challenges still remain for understanding the full impact of no-till adoption on soil organic C stocks, such as changes on C inputs in deeper subsurface horizons, the influence of variation in NT seeding methods on soil disturbance, and changes in SOM stabilization due to saturation limits in mineral soil fractions, which may further modify net C storage in soils.},

This change in ESE practice implies a relocation of the process of environmental knowledge constitution from ‘before' to ‘in' the educational event. The aim of this paper is to clarify both the processes of knowledge constitution and the content of the constituted knowledge within participatory ESE practices. Two methods based on John Dewey's transactional perspective are used in the study: epistemological move analysis and pragmatic discourse analysis. The empirical material consists of video-recorded student discussions about climate change in the setting of a Swedish upper secondary school with a pronounced sustainability approach. In the analyses, six different epistemological moves used by the students are identified. The analyses show how students cooperatively constitute a specific view of climate change by using these moves. A main conclusion of this study is that participatory approaches do not necessarily mean that knowledge becomes more diverse. It is therefore important that teachers pay attention to governing processes among students and occasionally challenge the common view in order to allow for alternative possibilities and views.},

We used14C signature, analytical thermal analysis, and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry to determine the influence of deciduous and coniferous forest vegetation type and soil depth on the stability of soil C. The14C mean residence time (MRT) of the illuvial B horizon soils averaged 1350 years for the deciduous soils and 795 years for the coniferous soils. The difference of MRT between mineral soils by forest type may be due to the saturation of extractable Fe and Al minerals binding sites by SOM in the coniferous soils, allowing greater transport of modern SOM from the O horizon down the soil profile, as compared with the non-saturated minerals in the deciduous soil profile. The molecular mass distribution of the deciduous water-extractable aromatic SOM fraction was shifted to a lower mass range in the lower portion of B horizon soil compared with the upper portion, indicating preferential sorption of the higher mass aromatic fraction. The shift in the mass distribution of the aromatic fraction in the coniferous soil was much less than in the deciduous soil, which supports the view that the extractable metal minerals had reached saturation. We conclude that greater transport of modern O horizon SOM to the lower mineral B horizons in the coniferous soil profile resulted in its radiocarbon enrichment and shorter estimated MRT. Our findings highlight the importance of forest vegetation type, soil depth and transport mechanisms on SOM stability, and suggest important ecological implications for changes in forest composition on the terrestrial C cycle.},

  abstract = {The partitioning of net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) into photosynthesis and respiration can be challenging and is often associated with assumptions that yield unknown amounts of uncertainty, thereby hindering model development. This occurs because we are inferring two pieces of information from one equation and measurement, NEE. While there are multiple methods for partitioning NEE, each has unique limitations that are difficult to evaluate as these techniques are often not implemented simultaneously. Here we present an analysis of multiple partitioning methods (a non-linear regression model known as the Reichstein method, artificial neural networks (ANN), stable carbon isotopes, and soil respiration (Rsoil) measurements) under ideal field conditions. We measured ecosystem-scale fluxes of stable C isotopes via a new quantum cascade laser (QCL) spectrometer and paired those measurements with a biophysical model CANVEG in order to close a system of equations and solve for gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco). Isotope-partitioned GPP and Reco were on average 10–13\% lower than Reichstein- and ANN-partitioned GPP and Reco. These results suggest that the Reichstein and ANN approaches, which use nighttime NEE to infer daytime Reco, may be overestimating Reco and GPP during the day. This may be attributed to higher plant respiration rates at night compared to the day, otherwise known as the Kok effect. As isotope measurements and theory become more accessible to diverse ecosystems it will grow to be more than a benchmarking technique and into a valuable means of improving understanding of carbon cycling. Future studies are encouraged to evaluate these techniques in increasingly complex ecosystems to determine when significant differences appear between partitioning methods and how those differences influence modeling of terrestrial carbon budgets.},

  abstract = {The size of the soil carbon sink depends on the balance between soil organic matter (SOM) formation and decomposition. Our understanding of how SOM forms and is stabilized, however, is shifting. Traditional theory maintains the formation of SOM is due to chemical complexity: difficult to decompose plant inputs persist in the soil while easily decomposable inputs are respired as CO2. However, consensus is now building around an alternative thesis, hypothesizing that the plant inputs most easily assimilated by soil decomposers are the ones stabilized as SOM because dead microbial biomass is now considered one of the primary components of stable SOM. As such, the efficiency with which the microbial community uses these plant inputs has direct implications for the amount and rate of SOM formation under both a constant and changing climate. Our study empirically tests and measures the effects of substrate quality, quantity, and temperature on SOM formation rates – a process that may have profound impact on carbon stocks. We used 13C-labeled substrates representative of plant root exudates (simple sugars, amino acids, and organic acids) to determine the proportion of substrate retained within SOM, microbial biomass, dissolved organic carbon, or evolved as 13CO2. We found that glucose, the substrate most efficiently assimilated by the microbial biomass, leads to the greatest amount of SOM formation compared to glycine and oxalic acid. In contrast to expectations, higher concentrations of substrate addition lead to proportionally less 13C label retention than lower concentrations. Temperature had a negligible impact on SOM formation, with higher temperatures actually leading to slight increases in SOM formation. While substrate quality and quantity drove the largest differences in SOM formation rates, once metabolized by the microbial biomass, eventual incorporation of carbon into the mineral associated SOM pool (thought to be the most stable of the soil C pools), was effectively equivalent across treatments. Our data suggest that changing composition and amount of labile carbon substrates supplied to soils will likely be key determinants of SOM formation rates and, hence, potentially soil carbon stock sizes.},

They recognize its merits in providing unbiased estimates with minimum variance. Several statistical packages now have the facilities they require, as do some geographic information systems. In the latter kriging is an option for interpolation that can be done at the press of a few buttons. Unfortunately, the ease conferred by this allows one to krige without understanding and to produce unreliable and even misleading results. Crucial for sound kriging is a plausible function for the spatial covariances or, more widely, of the variogram. The variogram must be estimated reliably and then modelled with valid mathematical functions. This requires an understanding of the assumptions in the underlying theory of random processes on which geostatistics is based. Here we guide readers through computing the sample variogram and modelling it by weighted least-squares fitting. We explain how to choose the most suitable functions by a combination of graphics and statistical diagnostics. Ordinary kriging follows straightforwardly from the model, but small changes in the model function and its parameters can affect the kriging error variances. When kriging is automated these effects remain unknown. We explain the choices to be made when kriging, i.e. whether the support is at points or over blocks, and whether the predictions are global or within moving windows. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) is frequently determined by the Walkley-Black (WB) method. A limitation of the test is incomplete oxidation of the carbon fraction and underestimation of SOC. Automated dry combustion methods are expensive and slow. Optical sensing and chemometric analysis offer the potential of an economical method capable of quantifying SOC fractions. The aim of this study was to identify the best SOC analysis method to facilitate maximum sampling resolution based on the cost per sample, analytical accuracy and time. A comparative evaluation was made of five techniques; (1) the WB method, (2) total combustion by total organic C analyser, (3) infrared (IR) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, (4) a portable spectroradiometer and (5) laboratory hyperspectral imaging. This involved assessing equipment costs, consumables and time to derive total analytical cost. The benefits were sample throughput and analytical accuracy. Instrumentation represented the largest input to analytical cost and for optical methods was governed by the spectral range. In contrast to dry combustion, this cost is offset by high sample throughput and minimal consumable requirements for IR spectroscopy and hyperspectral imaging. Hyperspectral imaging is identified as the most rapid technique with potential to scan about 720 samples per day at 90\% less cost than the WB method. The opportunity cost of hyperspectral imaging is to forfeit some analytical accuracy associated with the dry combustion method. Dry combustion, despite its high cost per sample, incurs no further costs associated with updating prediction models or developing site or soil specific correction factors. © 2011 The Authors.

  abstract = {This review explores the role of land use and land use change as a determinant of the soil's ability to sequester and store carbon in the UK. Over 95 percent of the UK land carbon stock is located in soils which are subjected to a range of land uses and global changes. Land use change can result in rapid soil loss of carbon from peatlands, grasslands, plantation forest and native woodland. Soil carbon accumulates more slowly (decadal) but gains can be made when croplands are converted to grasslands, plantation forest or native woodland. The need for land for food production and renewable forms of energy could have considerable influence on UK soil carbon storage in the future. There is a need to recognise the risk of soil carbon losses occurring when land use change to increase carbon storage is offset by compensatory land use conversions elsewhere that result in net carbon release. The protection of peatland and other organic soil carbon stocks, and the management of cropland, grassland and forest soils to increase carbon sequestration, will be crucial to the maintenance of the UK carbon balance. It will be necessary to develop policy to balance trade-offs between soil carbon gains with other land use priorities. These include the sustainable production of food, bio-energy and fibre crops and livestock, water quality and hydrology, greenhouse gas emission control and waste management, all of which are underpinned by the soil. © 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.},

  abstract = {Although subsurface horizons store more than half the total soil organic carbon (SOC) globally, the sources and dynamics of subsurface SOC are still unknown. Root litter input and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) transport are possible sources. Using a vertically extended soil C model, we explore the role of root C input and DOC transport in controlling subsurface SOC dynamics. The model involves organic matter decomposition and DOC leaching in the aboveground litter layer, the belowground input of C from roots, and SOC turnover and DOC transport along water flows throughout the soil profile for three SOC pools (active, slow, and passive — characterized by a turnover time of years, decades, and millennia, respectively). Model simulations with a range of rooting profiles demonstrate that a large proportion (36\% – 78\% — greater in deeper rooting profiles) of SOC is apportioned to the subsurface horizons (below the top 30 cm). A significant part (39\% – 73\%) of subsurface SOC was found to be associated with C pools that turn over on time scales of decades or less. DOC transport appeared to be dominant in distributing the added C to the deeper soil layers, making the SOC content profile deeper than that of the root litter (C) input. The results suggest that current soil C studies focusing on the surface alone, significantly underestimate the stock of decadally cycling C, especially for deeply rooted ecosystems. Studies ignoring subsurface C dynamics therefore underpredict the responses of soil C to changes in climate, land use, and vegetation.},

However, methods that selectively isolate these groups of compounds are underdeveloped. In this study, we isolate biomarkers by a successive series of extraction and chemical degradation procedures involving solvent extraction (TSE), base (BHY) and acid hydrolysis (AHY), and CuO oxidation (CUO). GC-MS was used to analyze these fractions and the extraction methods were verified by solid-state C-13 NMR spectroscopy. The GC-MS response was high for the BHY products (96\%), intermediate for the TSE (30\%) and CUO (19\%), but very low for the AHY fraction (5\%) indicating that the fractions contain polar or high molecular weight compounds. Aliphatic lipids (62\%), phenols and benzyls (17\%) were the predominant classes, accompanied by minor abundances of mono- and disaccharides, LMW acids, terpenoids, steroids, amino acids, and amino sugars. The TSE and BHY fractions contained mainly aliphatic lipids derived from plant waxes, cutin, and suberin. Ligninderived phenols are the major products in the CUO fraction, and amino compounds and carbohydrates of various sources were identified in the AHY products. The sequential degradation method is useful for the isolation and identification of apolar, LMW biomarkers in soil.},

In this study, five methods to determine total and fine bulk density and coarse-fragment content of a rocky forest soil in western Montana were evaluated. Two methods of core sampling (small and large diameter cylinders), two methods of soil excavation and volume determination (water and polyurethane foam), and a nuclear source moisture gauge were tested at two depths (0-10 cm and 10-20 cm) on a soil with a 35\% slope and 45\% rock content. In the surface 10 cm, total and fine soil bulk density values were greatest from the nuclear gauge. The two excavation techniques gave similar results. Volumetric rock-fragment content calculations using the small diameter cylinder were significantly lower than those using the other methods. At the 10- to 20-cm depth, all methods except the large diameter cylinder gave comparable results for total soil bulk density. The small diameter core method gave the highest estimate of fine bulk density at this depth. All methods are easy to use. Soil excavation using the polyurethane foam for volume determinations is the simplest method and has low standard errors. S},

This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

A calibration procedure based on canonical correspondence analysis predicted a mean rate of elevational displacement of 172.1 m/degrees-latitude for Lassen sites in Yosemite. This is a steep latitudinal gradient compared with other temperature uplands (which average around 100 m/degrees-latitude), but it corresponds with the magnitude of the July mean temperature gradient (143 m/degrees-latitude) and the annual precipitation gradient (230 m/degrees-latitude). Elevational displacement of basal-area weighted species means showed considerable variation. The range for montane species was 20-153 m/degrees-latitude; for subalpine species the range was 142-305 m/degrees-latitude. This disparity is related to differential temperature lapse rates between regions and is reinforced by contrasting biogeographic affinities of montane vs. subalpine species. Whereas it is uniformly hot and dry during the growing season at lower elevations in both regions, growing seasons in the subalpine zone are significantly warmer and drier (at comparable elevations) in Yosemite, the more southerly locale. Furthermore, montane species are principally of Sierran affinity, whereas subalpine species are primarily of Pacific Northwestern affinity.},

The model was developed using laboratory denitrification gas flux data and field-observed N:O gas fluxes from different sites. Controls over nitrification N:O gas fluxes are soil texture, soil NHn, soil water- filled pore space, soil N turnover rate, soil pH, and soil temperature. Observed data suggest that nitrification N:O gas fluxes are proportional to soil N turnover and that soil NHn levels only impact N:O gas fluxes with high levels of soil NHn ({$>$}3/,tg N g-l). Total alenitrification (N2 plus N:O) gas fluxes are a function of soil heterotrophic respiration rates, soil NO3, soil water content, and soil texture. N::N:O ratio is a function of soil water content, soil NO3, and soil heterotrophic respiration rates. The denitrification model was developed using laboratory data [Weier et al., 1993] where soil water content, soil NO•, and soil C availability were varied using a full factorial design. The Weier's model simulated observed N: and N20 gas fluxes for different soils quite well with r • equal to 0.62 and 0.75, respectively. Comparison of simulated model results with field N:O data for several validation sites shows that the model results compare well with the observed data (r • = 0.62). Winter denitrification events were poorly simulated by the model. This problem could have been caused by spatial and temporal variations in the observed soil water data and N20 fluxes. The model results and observed data suggest that approximately 14\% of the N:O fluxes for a shortgrass steppe are a result of denitrification and that this percentage ranged from 0\% to 59\% for different sites.},

  abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) mineralization processes are central to the functioning of soils in relation to feedbacks with atmospheric CO2 concentration, to sustainable nutrient supply, to structural stability and in supporting biodiversity. Recognition that labile C-inputs to soil (e.g. plant-derived) can significantly affect mineralization of SOM ('priming effects') complicates prediction of environmental and land-use change effects on SOM dynamics and soil C-balance. The aim of this study is to construct response functions for SOM priming to labile C (glucose) addition rates, for four contrasting soils. Six rates of glucose (3 atm\% (13) C) addition (in the range 0-1 mg glucose g(-1) soil day(-1) ) were applied for 8 days. Soil CO2 efflux was partitioned into SOM- and glucose-derived components by isotopic mass balance, allowing quantification of SOM priming over time for each soil type. Priming effects resulting from pool substitution effects in the microbial biomass ('apparent priming') were accounted for by determining treatment effects on microbial biomass size and isotopic composition. In general, SOM priming increased with glucose addition rate, approaching maximum rates specific for each soil (up to 200\%). Where glucose additions saturated microbial utilization capacity ({$>$}0.5 mg glucose g(-1) soil), priming was a soil-specific function of glucose mineralization rate. At low to intermediate glucose addition rates, the magnitude (and direction) of priming effects was more variable. These results are consistent with the view that SOM priming is supported by the availability of labile C, that priming is not a ubiquitous function of all components of microbial communities and that soils differ in the extent to which labile C stimulates priming. That priming effects can be represented as response functions to labile C addition rates may be a means of their explicit representation in soil C-models. However, these response functions are soil-specific and may be affected by several interacting factors at lower addition rates.},

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {$<$}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event.

  abstract = {This paper discusses advantages and shortcomings of the S environment for multivariable geostatistics, in particular when extended with the gstat package, an extension package for the S environments (R, S-Plus). The gstat S package provides multivariable geostatistical modelling, prediction and simulation, as well as several visualisation functions. In particular, it makes the calculation, simultaneous fitting, and visualisation of a large number of direct and cross (residual) variograms very easy. Gstat was started 10 years ago and was released under the GPL in 1996; gstat.org was started in 1998. Gstat was not initially written for teaching purposes, but for research purposes, emphasising flexibility, scalability and portability. It can deal with a large number of practical issues in geostatistics, including change of support (block kriging), simple/ordinary/universal (co)kriging, fast local neighbourhood selection, flexible trend modelling, variables with different sampling configurations, and efficient simulation of large spatially correlated random fields, indicator kriging and simulation, and (directional) variogram and cross variogram modelling. The formula/models interface of the S language is used to define multivariable geostatistical models. This paper introduces the gstat S package, and discusses a number of design and implementation issues. It also draws attention to a number of papers on integration of spatial statistics software, GIS and the S environment that were presented on the spatial statistics workshop and sessions during the conference Distributed Statistical Computing 2003. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Terrain attributes derived from digital elevation models have been used widely for mapping soil organic matter (SOM). Among these attributes, the topographic wetness index (TWI), an index for quantitatively indicating the balance between water accumulation and drainage conditions at the local scale, has been shown to correlate with SOM. However, TWIs used in most studies are calculated using a single-flow-direction (SFD) algorithm, which assumes that all water from a grid cell flows into only one neighboring cell. This assumption is not always valid, especially in areas with low relief where movement of water may be divergent. To overcome this SFD limitation, a multiple-flow-direction (MFD) algorithm has been developed, which distributes flow from a grid cell to several downslope neighbors. In this study we compared the effect of TWI calculations based on SFD and MFD in predictive mapping of SOM by incorporating them into different kriging methods over a 51.76 km2 area in Nenjiang County of northeastern China. We found that the MFD-based TWI was better correlated with SOM than was the SFD-based index. We then compared the accuracies of SOM maps which were derived from MFD-based TWI and SFD-based TWI incorporated by ordinary kriging (OK), simple kriging with varying local means (SKlm), kriging with external drift (KED) and collocated cokriging (CC). The MFD-based TWI, used as a secondary variable in SKlm and CC, outperforms the SFD-based TWI. For the different kriging methods, CC (incorporating either MFD-based TWI or SFD-based TWI) showed the best performance, and OK generated a better result than SKlm and KED. Both the MFD-based TWI and SFD-based TWI proved to be incompatible with KED and SKlm due to their numerical instability caused by the rough TWI surfaces. Among all predictive methods, CC incorporating the MFD-based TWI produced the best results. This is because: (1) the MFD-based TWI is best able to indicate quantitatively soil moisture and therefore has the strongest correlation with SOM; (2) CC is capable of utilizing effectively the spatial auto-correlation of SOM and the cross-correlation between SOM and the MFD-based TWI. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {One paradigm in biogeochemistry is that frequent disturbance tends to deplete carbon (C) in soil organic matter (SOM) by reducing biomass inputs and promoting losses. However, disturbance by fire has challenged this paradigm because soil C responses to frequent and/or intense fires are highly variable, despite observed declines in biomass inputs. Here, we review recent advances to illustrate that fire-driven changes in decomposition, mediated by altered SOM stability, are an important compensatory process offsetting declines in aboveground biomass pools. Fire alters the stability of SOM by affecting both the physicochemical properties of the SOM and the environmental drivers of decomposition, potentially offsetting C lost via combustion, but the mechanisms affecting the SOM stability differ across ecosystems. Thus, shifting our focus from a top-down view of fire impacting C cycling via changes in plant biomass to a bottom-up view of changes in decomposition may help to elucidate counterintuitive trends in the response of SOM to burning. Given that 70\% of global topsoil C is in fire-prone regions, using fire to promote SOM stability may be an important nature-based climate solution to increase C storage.},

Model-based approaches to estimate changes in soil C stocks exist, but they cannot fully replace repeated measurements. Measuring changes in soil C is laborious due to small expected changes and large spatial variation. Stratification of soil sampling allows the reduction of sample size without reducing precision. If there are no previous measurements, the stratification can be made with model-predictions of target variable. Our aim was to present a simulation-based stratification method, and to estimate how much stratification of inventory plots could improve the efficiency of the sampling. The effect of large uncertainties related to soil C change measurements and simulated predictions was targeted since they may considerably decrease the efficiency of stratification. According to our simulations, stratification can be useful with a feasible soil sample number if other uncertainties (simulated predictions and forecasted forest management) can be controlled. For example, the optimal (Neyman) allocation of plots to 4 strata with 10 soil samples from each plot (unpaired repeated sampling) reduced the standard error (SE) of the stratified mean by 9-34\% from that of simple random sampling, depending on the assumptions of uncertainties. When the uncertainties of measurements and simulations were not accounted for in the division to strata, the decreases of SEs were 2-9 units less. Stratified sampling scheme that accounts for the uncertainties in measured material and in the correlates (simulated predictions) is recommended for the sampling design of soil C stock changes.},

We investigated relation- ships between soil organic C and various soil and site properties that may influence long-term soil C accumulation across a range of soil orders in New Zealand. We used pedon and climatic data for 167 pedons under permanent grass, and carried out regression analysis between soil C (0–200 mm) contents (t ha⫺1 ) or concentrations (g kg⫺1 ) and climatic and soil properties, namely, precipitation, tempera- ture, and contents or concentrations of sand, silt, clay, pyrophosphate- extractable Al (Alpy ), Fe oxide, and allophane. Soil clay content or concentration explained little of the variation in soil C across all soils (R2 ⬍ 0.05) and within each soil type. Likewise, mean annual precipitation and temperature explained little variation in soil C con- tent or concentration (R2 ⬍ 0.15 for precipitation, R2 ⫽ 0.04 for temperature). Allophane content or concentration was unrelated to soil C in the soils of volcanic origin; Alpy , however, correlated strongly with both soil C content and soil C concentration across all soil types (R2 ⫽ 0.55 and 0.60, respectively). When all factors were combined in amultiple regression analysis, the combination ofAlpy and allophane contents explained the greatest amount of variation in soil C content (R2 ⫽ 0.57), whereas the combination of Alpy , Fe oxide, allophane, and clay concentrations explained the greatest amount of variation in soil C concentration (R2 ⫽ 0.67). Our results suggest that in New Zealand soils, chemical stabilization of organic matter is the key pro- cess controlling soil C accumulation, and that clay content relates poorly to long-term soil organic C accumulation.},

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the presence and topographical position of PVS on soil and plant carbon (C) and N stocks relative to annual crop and native prairie vegetation. The study was implemented within three small adjacent watersheds, treated with one of the following cover types: (1) 100\% row-crop agriculture (CROP); (2) 20\% prairie vegetation (PVS) distributed along the contour across three topographical positions: upslope, sideslope and footslope position; and (3) 100\% 17-year old reconstructed native prairie (RNP) as the control condition. Total soil organic C (SOC), total soil N (TN), inorganic N availability as indexed by ion exchange resins, N stocks in plant biomass and litter, and the ratio of C3:C4 plant species were measured during the 2010 growing season. Results showed that over five years of treatment, PVS footslope improved soil quality by increasing TN by almost 100\% and SOC by 37\%; while CROP footslope TN decreased by 31\% and SOC decreased by 28\%. Overall, N stocks in plant biomass and litter were higher in PVS compared with RNP, except in the footslope where the lower N plant stocks was associated with higher C3 abundance in RNP. Nitrogen availability was higher in CROP (25.4±1.4), followed by PVS (10.2±1.3), and RNP (2.2±1.4); with the highest values recorded in the upslope position for PVS and RNP, and the footslope for CROP. These findings are important for designing watersheds with PVS to reduce N accumulation in the footslope position and promote additional N retention in soil organic matter and plant biomass, thereby minimizing N losses to streams. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The interest of such relationships rests with the possibility of using simple and rapid techniques to estimate SOC and BD. It is also a crucial step in establishing the correspondence among several data bases when SOC data are obtained using different measurement techniques. In this study, SOC was measured by dry combustion (SOCDC) and wet digestion (SOCWD) methods, and organic matter by loss-on-ignition (LOI). Our results suggest that, in these soils: (1) LOI can be used for estimating SOC (r2?0.95, RMSEP?16\%) and SOCDC/SOM significantly decreased with increasing depth from 0.49 to 0.27; (2) SOCDC and SOCWD were highly correlated. Even if SOCWD provided near complete recovery of SOCDC, dry combustion remains the preferred method for SOC analysis since SOCWD recovery decreased with increasing depth from 100 to 83\%. (3) BD was also strongly related to SOM (r2?0.81). We recommend using the organic density approach to estimate BD from SOM because it allows BD to be predicted without significant bias and with a degree of accuracy of 14\%.},

The plots of Earth science stories are not those of literary traditions, nor those of persuasion or moral philosophy, and deserve separate consideration. Earth science plots do not conform those of storytelling more generally, implying that Earth scientists may have fundamentally different motivations than other storytellers, and that the basic plots of Earth Science derive from the characteristics and behaviors of Earth systems. In some cases preference or affinity to different plots results in fundamentally different interpretations and conclusions of the same evidence. In other situations exploration of additional plots could help resolve scientific controversies. Thus explicit acknowledgement of plots can yield direct scientific benefits.

  abstract = {While radiocarbon (14C) abundances in standing stocks of soil carbon have been used to evaluate rates of soil carbon turnover on timescales of several years to centuries, soil-respired 14CO2 measurements are an important tool for identifying more immediate responses to disturbance and climate change. Soil Δ14CO2 data, however, are often temporally sparse and could be interpreted better with more context for typical seasonal ranges and trends. We report on a semi-high-frequency sampling campaign to distinguish physical and biological drivers of soil Δ14CO2 at a temperate forest site in northern Wisconsin, USA. We sampled 14CO2 profiles every three weeks during snow-free months through 2012 in three intact plots and one trenched plot that excluded roots. Respired Δ14CO2 declined through the summer in intact plots, shifting from an older C composition that contained more bomb 14C to a younger composition more closely resembling present 14C levels in the atmosphere. In the trenched plot, respired Δ14CO2 was variable but remained comparatively higher than in intact plots, reflecting older bomb-enriched 14C sources. Although respired Δ14CO2 from intact plots correlated with soil moisture, related analyses did not support a clear cause-and-effect relationship with moisture. The initial decrease in Δ14CO2 from spring to midsummer could be explained by increases in 14C-deplete root respiration; however, Δ14CO2 continued to decline in late summer after root activity decreased. We also investigated whether soil moisture impacted vertical partitioning of CO2 production, but found this had little effect on respired Δ14CO2 because CO2 contained modern bomb C at depth, even in the trenched plot. This surprising result contrasted with decades to centuries-old pre-bomb CO2 produced in lab incubations of the same soils. Our results suggest that root-derived C and other recent C sources had dominant impacts on respired Δ14CO2 in situ, even at depth. We propose that Δ14CO2 may have declined through late summer in intact plots because of continued microbial turnover of root-derived C, following declines in root respiration. Our results agree with other studies showing declines in the 14C content of soil respiration over the growing season, and suggest inputs of new photosynthates through roots are an important driver.},

Scope We identify three major challenges in interpreting R S data, and opportunities to utilize it more extensively and creatively: (1) When R S is compared to ecosystem respiration (R ECO) measured from EC towers, it is not uncommon to find R S {$>$} R ECO . We argue this is most likely due to difficulties in calculating R ECO , which pro-vides an opportunity to utilize R S for EC quality control. (2) R S integrates belowground heterotrophic and autotro-phic activity, but many models include only an explicit heterotrophic output. Opportunities exist to use the total R S flux for data assimilation and model benchmarking methods rather than less-certain partitioned fluxes. (3) R S is generally measured at a very different resolution than that needed for comparison to EC or ecosystem-to global-scale models. Downscaling EC fluxes to match the scale of R S , and improvement of R S upscaling tech-niques will improve resolution challenges. Conclusions R S data can bring a range of benefits to model development, particularly with larger databases and improved data sharing protocols to make R S data more robust and broadly available to the research community.

However, there have been relatively few investigations of how soils will warm in comparison to the atmosphere. Three recent papers in AGU journals have looked at expected soil warming by synthesizing predictions in the Climate Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5). Collectively, conclusions from these papers show that soil warming will keep pace with air warming except where snow and ice occur, and that the magnitude of soil warming in northern latitudes is uncertain due to model variability in snow and ice extent. They also show that a considerable portion of anthropogenic warming is being stored in deep soils, and that in comparison to observations soil heat storage is underrepresented by land models. These studies highlight how important continued investigations of soil climatology are to understanding carbon cycling and earth energy balance.},

Although the origin of this CO2 is debated, we show that the pulse of CO2 is produced by a three-step resuscitation of the indigenous microbial community. Specific phylogenetic groups of microorganisms activate and con- tribute to the CO2 pulse at different times after a simulation of the first rainfall following the severe summer drought. Differential resuscitation was evident within 1 h of wet-up, with three primary response strategies apparent according to patterns of relative ri- bosomal quantity. Most bacteria could be classified as rapid res- ponders (within 1 h of wet-up), intermediate responders (between 3 and 24 h after wet-up), or delayed responders (24–72 h after wet-up). Relative ribosomal quantities of rapid responders were as high in the prewet dry soils as at any other time, suggesting that specific groups of organisms may be poised to respond to the wet-up event, in that they preserve their capacity to synthesize proteins rapidly. Microbial response patterns displayed phyloge- netic clustering and were primarily conserved at the subphylum level, suggesting that resuscitation strategies after wet-up of dry soil may be a phylogenetically conserved ecological trait.},

  abstract = {Current models of soil organic carbon (SOC) include a passive pool representing refractory soil organic matter (RSOM) with turnover times of hundreds to thousands of years. These models suggest that, as total soil C is depleted, it becomes proportionally enriched in RSOM. The objectives of our study were to quantify clay-associated organic matter resistant to peroxide treatment in soils presumed to have differing proportions of RSOM, hypothesizing that peroxide-resistant C in the clay fraction belongs to RSOM, and that its proportion will increase with total C depletion. Clay fractions ({$<$} 2 µm) from three soils from a cultivation sequence, differing in the duration of cultivation, one long-term cultivated soil and one long-term bare fallow soil corresponded to samples increasingly depleted in total organic C. Samples were suspended in 30\% hydrogen peroxide and treated until no changes in C concentration were observed. Total C in the clay-peroxide suspensions decreased exponentially and displayed kinetics corresponding to labile, intermediate and peroxide-resistant pools. Carbon isotope analyses showed an enrichment of 13C in samples after peroxide treatment, compared with before, that decreased from 8‰ in forest samples to 0‰ in long-term bare fallow. The proportion of peroxide-resistant C did not differ between soils and represented 12\% of initial clay-associated organic C. No proportional increase with soil C depletion was observed and when expressed on a whole-soil basis, the results underestimated proposed values for the RSOM pool, suggesting that peroxide treatment may not be appropriate for the estimation of the RSOM pool. Oxydation à l'eau oxygénée de la matière organique de la fraction argiles des sols d'une chronosequence de mise en culture Résumé Les modèles actuels de la dynamique du carbone dans les sols prévoient un compartiment de carbone stable, caractérisé par des temps de renouvellement de l'ordre du siècle au millénaire. Ces modèles suggèrent que si les sols s'appauvrissent en carbone, ils devraient proportionnellement s'enrichir en carbone stable. Nous avons fait l'hypothèse qu'une partie de ce carbone stable était présent dans des matières organiques résistantes à l'eau oxygénée de la fraction argiles des sols ({$<$} 2 µm). Ce travail avait donc pour objectif de quantifier ces matières organiques, dans des sols correspondant à une gamme de teneurs en carbone décroissantes: trois sols provenant d'une chronoséquence de mise en culture, différant par la durée de la culture, un sol cultivé depuis de nombreuses années, et un sol provenant d'un essai de longue durée en jachère nue. Les fractions {$<$} 2 µm de ces sols ont été agitées en suspension dans des solutions d'eau oxygénée (30\%) jusqu'à ce que leur teneur en carbone se stabilise. Les teneurs en carbone des fractions ont diminué suivant une loi exponentielle et nous avons distingué des compartiments labile, moyennement résistants et stables vis à vis de l'oxydation à H2O2. La fraction résistante à l'eau oxygénée était généralement enrichie en 13C de 0‰ (jachère nue) à 8‰ (sol sous forêt). La proportion de C résistant à l'eau oxygénée s'est avérée être constante et égale 12\% du carbone des fractions {$<$} 2 µm pour les différents sols. Le fait que la proportion de C résistant à l'eau oxygénée dans les fractions argile n'augmente pas avec l'appauvrissement en C des sols, tend à montrer que cette méthode ne permet pas d'isoler le carbone stable des sols.},

  abstract = {The various ecosystem functions of soil organic matter (SOM) depend on both its quantity and stability. Numerous fractionation techniques have been developed to characterize SOM stability, and thermal analysis techniques have shown promising results to describe the complete continuum of SOM in whole soil samples. However, the potential link between SOM thermal stability and biological or chemical stability has not yet been adequately explored. The objective of this study was to compare conventional chemical and biological methods used to characterize SOM stability with results obtained by thermal analysis techniques. Surface soil samples were collected from four North American grassland sites along a continental mean annual temperature gradient, each with a native and cultivated land use. Soil organic C concentrations ranged from 6.8 to 33 g C kg-1 soil. Soils were incubated for 588 days at 35 °C, and C mineralization rates were determined periodically throughout the incubation by measuring CO2 concentration using an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) to calculate biological indices of SOM stability. Hot-water extractable organic C (HWEOC) contents were determined before and after incubation as chemical indices. Finally, samples from before and after incubation were analyzed by simultaneous thermal analysis (i.e., thermogravimetry (TG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)) to determine thermal indices of SOM stability. Long-term incubation resulted in the mineralization of up to 33\% of initial soil C. The number of days required to respire 5\% of initial soil organic carbon (SOC), ranged from 27 to 115 days, and is proposed as a standardized biological index of SOM stability. The number of days was greater for cultivated soils compared to soils under native vegetation, and generally decreased with increasing site mean annual temperature. HWEOC (as \% of initial SOC) did not show consistent responses to land use, but was significantly lower after long-term incubation. Energy density (J mg-1 OM) was greater for soils under native vegetation compared to cultivated soils, and long-term incubation also decreased energy density. The temperatures at which half of the mass loss or energy release occurred typically showed larger responses to land use change than to incubation. Strong correlations demonstrated a link between the thermal and biogeochemical stability of SOM, but the interpretation of the thermal behavior of SOM in bulk soil samples remains equivocal because of the role the mineral component and organo-mineral interactions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Radiocarbon analysis is an important tool in quantifying soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics within the terrestrial carbon cycle. However, there is increasing appreciation that representing SOM as a single, homogeneous pool with a single, mean 14C concentration is inadequate. We investigate whether the differing patterns in CO2 release during ramped-temperature oxidation reflect organic matter of different ages, and hypothesize that thermally labile SOM (combusting at low temperatures) consists of younger carbon than thermally resistant organic matter. Topsoil samples under contrasting land uses (native vegetation and long-term cultivation) were selected for 14C analysis before and after acid fumigation for the removal of carbonates. Results of bulk 14C analyses showed a significant shift in 14C age from 0.944 Fm under native vegetation to 0.790 Fm under cultivation. Four to 5 “fractions” associated with different CO2-evolution regions were identified by thermal analysis and analyzed for 14C via modifications to NOSAMS' established “programmed temperature pyrolysis system,” in which discrete CO2 fractions evolved during ramped-temperature oxidation were isotopically characterized by a microwave gas ion source (GIS) continuous-flow AMS (CFAMS) system. Results showed that while acid fumigation removed soil carbonates, the treatment also significantly altered the thermograms and inferred SOM composition. While direct attribution of 14C values to individual peaks is somewhat confounded by overlapping temperature ranges for oxidation of unique populations of carbon, in general, thermally stable fractions of SOM appear to be 14C-depleted compared to thermally reactive (low temperature) fractions regardless of pretreatment.

However, the large background of stable carbon (C) already present in the soil and the long period of time usually required to observe changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks have increased the necessity to identify soil C fractions with a fast response to changes in agricultural management practices. Consequently, we quantified the response of total SOC, permanganate oxidizable organic carbon (POxC), particulate organic carbon (POC) and the carbon concentration of water-stable macroaggregates, microaggregates within macroaggregates and the silt-plus clay-sized fraction (M-C, mM-C, s+cM-C, respectively) to changes in management. We chose a long-term tillage and N fertilization field experiment (18 years) located in NE Spain. In the first 5. cm depth under no-tillage (NT) compared with conventional tillage (CT), the POxC fraction and total SOC increased similarly (about 59\%). However, other C pools studied (i.e., M-C, M-POxC, mM-C, POC and s+cM-C) had lower increases with values ranging from 17\% to 31\%. For the 5-20 and 20-40. cm soil depths, the POC was the most sensitive fraction to tillage with 46\% and 54\% decrease when NT was compared to CT, respectively. Likewise, the POC fraction presented the highest response to N fertilization in the three depths studied (i.e., 0-5, 5-20 and 20-40. cm). The mM-C and s+cM-C fractions presented the lowest sensitivity to changes in tillage and N fertilization management. Our results showed that the POC fraction had the greatest sensitivity to changes in agricultural management practices, proving its ability as an early indicator of optimized practices to sequester C in soil. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Land-use change (LUC) is a major driving factor for the balance of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and the global carbon cycle. The temporal dynamic of SOC after LUC is especially important in temperate systems with a long reaction time. On the basis of 95 compiled studies covering 322 sites in the temperate zone, carbon response functions (CRFs) were derived to model the temporal dynamic of SOC after five different LUC types (mean soil depth of 30±6cm). Grassland establishment caused a long lasting carbon sink with a relative stock change of 128±23\% and afforestation on former cropland a sink of 116±54\%, 100 years after LUC (mean±95\% confidence interval). No new equilibrium was reached within 120 years. In contrast, there was no SOC sink following afforestation of grasslands and 75\% of all observations showed SOC losses, even after 100 years. Only in the forest floor, there was carbon accumulation of 0.38±0.04Mgha-1yr-1 in afforestations adding up to 38±4Mgha-1 labile carbon after 100 years. Carbon loss after deforestation (-32±20\%) and grassland conversion to cropland (-36±5\%), was rapid with a new SOC equilibrium being reached after 23 and 17 years, respectively. The change rate of SOC increased with temperature and precipitation but decreased with soil depth and clay content. Subsoil SOC changes followed the trend of the topsoil SOC changes but were smaller (25±5\% of the total SOC changes) and with a high uncertainty due to a limited number of datasets. As a simple and robust model approach, the developed CRFs provide an easily applicable tool to estimate SOC stock changes after LUC to improve greenhouse gas reporting in the framework of UNFCCC. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {Increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) in agricultural soils can mitigate atmospheric CO2 concentration and also contribute to increase soil fertility and ecosystem resilience. The role of major nutrients on SOC dynamics is complex, due to simultaneous effects on net primary productivity (NPP) that influence crop residue carbon inputs and on the rate of heterotrophic respiration (carbon outputs). This study investigated the effect on SOC stocks of three different levels of phosphorus and potassium (PK) fertilisation rates in the absence of nitrogen fertilisation and of three different levels of nitrogen in the absence of PK. This was done by analysing data from 10 meta-replicated Swedish long-term field experiments ({$>$} 45 years). With N fertilisation, SOC stocks followed yield increases. However, for all PK levels, we found average SOC losses ranging from −0.04 ± 0.09 Mg ha−1 yr−1 (ns) for the lowest to −0.09 ± 0.07 Mg ha−1 yr−1 (p = 0.008) for the highest application rate, while crop yields as a proxy for carbon input increased significantly with PK fertilization by 1, 10 and 15 \%. We conclude that SOC dynamics are mainly output-driven in the PK fertilised regime but mostly input-driven in the N fertilised regime, due to the much more pronounced response of NPP to N than to PK fertilisation. It has been established that P rather than K is the element affecting ecosystem carbon fluxes, where P fertilisation has been shown to: (i) stimulate heterotrophic respiration, (ii) reduce the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and (iii) decrease crop root : shoot ratio, leading to lower root-derived carbon input. The higher export of N in the PK fertilised plots in this study could (iv) have led to increased N mining and thus mineralisation of organic matter. More integrated experiments are needed to gain a better understanding of the relative importance of each of the above-mentioned mechanisms leading to SOC losses after P addition.},

  abstract = {Background and aims Carbon inputs to soil are mostly site-and management-nonspecific estimates based on measured yield. However, in grasslands most carbon input is root-derived and plant carbon allocation patterns are known to vary strongly across sites and management regimes. The aim here was to estimate carbon inputs by fitting the RothC model to time series of soil organic carbon (SOC) data from field sites and to explain the observed variability in root: shoot ratio (R:S). Methods Time series of SOC stocks in 15 different temperate grasslands were simulated using eight differ-ent literature-derived R:S values, which were compared to the optimised, site-specific R:S. The model-derived root inputs were validated with literature-derived root biomass data. Results A single, static R:S for yield-based carbon input estimation for all grasslands was not appropriate. Nitrogen fertilisation (R 2 = 0.57) significantly reduced the optimised R:S, which can be explained by the higher investment of plants in roots for nitrogen acquisition under nitrogen deficiency. The average R:S derived was 5.9 ± 1.9 for unfertilised soils and 2.4 ± 1.5 for fertilised soils. Conclusions The results enable distinction of unfertilised and fertilised temperate grasslands regarding carbon input parameterisation for the RothC model and highlight the importance of nutrient regime for the carbon cycle.},

  abstract = {Agricultural management effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) can be significant, but are often relatively small compared with the total SOC pool and its field-scale variability. In field experiments, completely uniform initial SOC concentrations across all plots are unlikely. Therefore, measured treatment effects through time are biased by these initial differences. This study questioned how much this bias can represent and whether it can be neglected or must be accounted for. In 1116 investigated pairs of treatments in 10 meta-replicated Swedish long-term soil fertility experiments, the average absolute initial difference in SOC was 1.3g Ckg-1, whereas the average absolute difference after about 50years of contrasting management was 1.5g Ckg-1. Initial differences in SOC were significantly correlated with final differences (R2=0.14) and in 47\% of all investigated pairs the absolute initial difference was higher than the absolute final difference. However, simple subtraction of initial differences between pairs from final differences to isolate the treatment effect neglect the fact that the soil with the higher initial SOC content will lose proportionally more C through mineralization during the experimental period higher SOC content caused higher SOC mineralisation during the experimental period. Therefore, a first-order kinetic model was used to predict the decrease in initial SOC differences over time as influenced by climate. We derived a generic empirical equation that can be used to account for this severe but inherent problem with plot experiments. According to the equation, 65 and 69\% of the initial differences in SOC between treatment pairs persisted after 50years under the climate conditions in southern and central Sweden, respectively. We conclude that initial differences can be severe and have to be accounted for. The proposed empirical equation can reduce the bias in treatment comparisons for different climatic conditions and contribute to improve the quality of data interpretation from long-term field experiments.},

  abstract = {Fractionation of soil organic carbon (SOC) is crucial for mechanistic understanding and modeling of soil organic matter decomposition and stabilization processes. It is often aimed at separating the bulk SOC into fractions with varying turnover rates, but a comprehensive comparison of methods to achieve this is lacking. In this study, a total of 20 different SOC fractionation methods were tested by participating laboratories for their suitability to isolate fractions with varying turnover rates, using agricultural soils from three experimental sites with vegetation change from C3 to C4 22–36 years ago. Enrichment of C4-derived carbon was traced and used as a proxy for turnover rates in the fractions. Methods that apply a combination of physical (density, size) and chemical (oxidation, extraction) fractionation were identified as most effective in separating SOC into fractions with distinct turnover rates. Coarse light SOC separated by density fractionation was the most C4-carbon enriched fraction, while oxidation-resistant SOC left after extraction with NaOCl was the least C4-carbon enriched fraction. Surprisingly, even after 36 years of C4 crop cultivation in a temperate climate, no method was able to isolate a fraction with more than 76\% turnover, which challenges the link to the most active plant-derived carbon pools in models. Particles with density {$>$}2.8 g cm−3 showed similar C4-carbon enrichment as oxidation-resistant SOC, highlighting the importance of sesquioxides for SOC stabilization. The importance of clay and silt-sized particles ({$<$}50 μm) for SOC stabilization was also confirmed. Particle size fractionation significantly outperformed aggregate size fractionation, due to the fact that larger aggregates contain smaller aggregates and organic matter particles of various sizes with different turnover rates. An evaluation scheme comprising different criteria was used to identify the most suitable methods for isolating fractions with distinct turnover rates, and potential benefits and trade-offs associated with a specific choice. Our findings can be of great help to select the appropriate method(s) for fractionation of agricultural soils.},

Since these effects are scale dependent, they are investigated at three different nested spatial scales: the microplot (4 × 10-6-10 ° m2), the mesoplot (10-2-102 m 2) and the macroplot (101 104 m2). For each scale the corresponding process mechanisms are discussed. Particular attention is paid to the effects of rock fragment cover on the intensity of soil erosion processes. At the mesoplot scale, i.e. on interrill areas, rock fragments at the soil surface can have negative as well as positive effects on sediment yield. These ambivalent effects are conditioned by the type of fine earth porosity, soil surface slope, vertical position and size of rock fragments and by the occurrence of horseshoe vortex erosion. At the microplot scale, i.e. the soil surface area which is covered by a single rock fragment, and at the macroplot scale, i.e. upland areas where both interrill and rill erosion takes place, rock fragments at the soil surface have a negative effect on sediment yield. In these two scales rock fragments can thus be considered as natural soil surface stabilizers. At the macroplot scale the mean decrease of relative interrill and rill sediment yield with rock fragment cover can be expressed by an exponential decay function. The scatter of the data indicates that a given rock fragment cover can have different efficiencies in reducing interrill and rill sediment yield depending on the varying intensities of the hydrological and erosion subprocesses. These findings have implications for erosion modelling and soil conservation. I.},

Adsorption complexes with varying carbon loadings were synthesized using different Fe oxyhydroxides (ferrihydrite, lepidocrocite, goethite, hematite, magnetite) and NOM of different origin (extracellular polymeric substances from Bacillus subtilis, OM extracted from soil Oi and Oa horizons). The adsorption complexes were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), N2 gas adsorption, electrophoretic mobility and particle size measurements, and OM desorption. Incubation experiments under anaerobic conditions were conducted for 16 days comparing two different strains of dissimilatory Fe(III)-reducing bacteria (Shewanella putrefaciens, Geobacter metallireducens). Mineral transformation during reduction was assessed via XRD and FTIR. Microbial reduction of the pure Fe oxyhydroxides was controlled by the specific surface area (SSA) and solubility of the minerals. For Shewanella putrefaciens, the Fe reduction of adsorption complexes strongly correlated with the concentration of potentially usable electron-shuttling molecules for NOM concentrations {$<$}2 mg C L−1, whereas for Geobacter metallireducens, Fe reduction depended on the particle size and thus aggregation of the adsorption complexes. These diverging results suggest that the influence of NOM on the stability of Fe-organic associations in soils cannot easily be assessed without considering the composition of the microbial soil community.},

  abstract = {The variation of soil properties down a profile is usually considered continuous. The aim of this study was to develop and test a methodology to model the continuous vertical and lateral distributions of SOC stocks in Scottish soils making explicit the modelling and spatial uncertainty of the results. A comparison with regression kriging and other depth function methods is provided to show that better performances can be achieved taking into account non-linear relationships between covariates and soil properties. The analysis was run for the whole of Scotland. The carbon stocks were calculated for each point, i.e. each horizon in each available profile. The stock value at each cell for each of the considered depth layers was defined using a hybrid GAM-geostatistical 3D model, combining: 1) the fitting of a GAM to estimate the trend of the variable, using a 3D smoother with related covariates; and 2) kriging or Gaussian simulations of GAM residuals as spatial component to account for local details. The use of GAM makes the approach flexible, because it is able to deal with both linear and non-linear relationships between soil properties and the considered covariates. The results confirmed that MODIS data are a useful source of information for DSM especially at national scale. When comparing the proposed approach with similar methods such as regression kriging, the results showed better agreement with the data in the validation set with a global R2 of 0.60. The median values obtained are comparable with the values reported from previous studies on stocks in Scotland using different methods. The uncertainty is large indicating a wide range of credible values for each pixel. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {In the detritusphere, particulate organic matter offers new sites for microorganisms, whereas soluble substrates are transported into the adjacent soil. We investigated how mechanisms of solute transport affect microbial abundance and function in the detritusphere. In a first experiment, transport was restricted to diffusion, whereas in a second experiment it was dominated by convection. Two soil moisture contents were established in each experiment. When diffusion was the exclusive transport mechanism, the addition of maize litter induced distinct gradients in enzyme activities, soil organic C content and microbial biomass to a depth of 1.5-2.8 mm. Convection enlarged these gradients to 2.5-3.0 mm. The moisture regime modified the temporal pattern of diffusive C transport, microbial growth and enzyme release by inducing faster transport at large water contents. Convective transport seemed to be unaffected by soil moisture content. Using a convective-diffusive transport model with first-order decay, it was possible to simulate the observed activity profiles. The results indicate that the spatial dimension of the detritusphere is governed by the ratio between decay rate of available substrates and transport rate. Bacteria and fungi showed differing utilization strategies as revealed by coupling phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis with stable isotope techniques. Fungi assimilated C directly in the litter, whereas bacteria took up the substrates in the soil and therefore depended more on transport processes than fungi. Our results demonstrate the impact of physicochemical conditions on the abundance and function of microorganisms in the detritusphere. Furthermore, the combination of enzymatic measurements and mathematical transport modelling may offer a new way to measure substrate decay rates in soil. © 2006 The Authors.},

  abstract = {Resolving the spatial and temporal dynamics of gross primary productivity (GPP) of terrestrial ecosystems across different scales remains a challenge. Remote sensing is regarded as the solution to upscale point observations conducted at the ecosystem level, using the eddy covariance (EC) technique, to the landscape and global levels. In addition to traditional vegetation indices, the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and the emission of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), now measurable from space, provide a new range of opportunities to monitor the global carbon cycle using remote sensing. However, the scale mismatch between EC observations and the much coarser satellite-derived data complicates the integration of the two sources of data. The solution is to establish a network of in situ spectral measurements that can act as bridge between EC measurements and remote sensing data. In situ spectral measurements have been already conducted for many years at EC sites, but using variable instrumentation, setups, and measurement standards. In Europe in particular, in situ spectral measurements remain highly heterogeneous. The goal of EUROSPEC Cost Action ES0930 was to promote the development of common measuring protocols and new instruments towards establishing best practices and standardization of in situ spectral measurements. In this review we describe the background and main tradeoffs of in situ spectral measurements, review the main results of EUROSPEC Cost Action, and discuss the future challenges and opportunities of in situ spectral measurements for improved estimation of local and global carbon cycle.},

Fe and Al can be strong predictors of SOC storage and turnover in soils with relatively high extractable metals content and moderately acidic to circumneutral pH. Here we test whether pedogenic Fe and Al influence SOC content and turnover in soils with low Fe and Al content and acidic pH. In soils from four sites spanning three soil orders, we quantified the amount of Fe and Al in operationally-defined poorly crystalline and organically-complexed phases using selective chemical dissolution applied to the soil fraction containing mineral-associated carbon. We evaluated the correlations of Fe and Al concentrations, mean annual precipitation (MAP), mean annual temperature (MAT), and pH with SOC content and 14C-based turnover times. We found that poorly crystalline Fe and Al content predicted SOC turnover times (p {$<$} 0.0001) consistent with findings of previous studies, while organically-complexed Fe and Al content was a better predictor of SOC concentration (p {$<$} 0.0001). Greater site-level MAP (p {$<$} 0.0001) and colder site-level MAT (p {$<$} 0.0001) were correlated with longer SOC turnover times but were not correlated with SOC content. Our results suggest that poorly crystalline Fe and Al effectively slow the turnover of SOC in these acidic soils, even when their combined content in the soil is less than 2\% by mass. However, in the strongly acidic Spodosol, organo-metal complexes tended to be less stable resulting in a more actively cycling mineral-associated SOC pool.},

There is a growing understanding that interactions with soil mineral phases contribute to the accumulation and retention of otherwise degradable organic matter (OM) in soils and sediments. However, the bioavailability of organic compounds in mineral-organic-associations (MOAs), especially under varying environmental conditions is not well known. To assess the impact of mineral association and warming on the decomposition of an easily respirable organic substrate (glucose), we conducted a series of laboratory incubations at different temperatures with field-collected soils from 10 to 20 cm, 50–60 cm, and 80–90 cm depth. We added 13 C-labeled glucose either directly to native soil or sorbed to one of two synthetic iron (hydr)oxide phases (goethite and ferrihydrite) that differ in crystallinity and affinity for sorbing glucose. We found that: (1) association with the Fe (hydr)oxide minerals reduced the decomposition rate of glucose by {$>$} 99.5\% relative to rate of decomposition for free glucose in soil; (2) the respiration rate per gram carbon did not differ appreciably with depth, suggesting a similar degree of decomposability for native C across depths and that under the incubation conditions total carbon availability represents the principal limitation on respiration under these conditions as opposed to reduced abundance of decomposers or moisture and oxygen limitations; (3) addition of free glucose enhanced native carbon respiration at all soil depths with the largest effect at 50–60 cm; (4) in general respiration of the organo-mineral complex (glucose and iron-(hydr)oxide) was less temperature sensitive than was respiration of native carbon; (5) the addition of organic free mineral decreased the rate of soil respiration in the intermediate 50–60 cm depth soil. The results emphasize the key role of MOAs in regulating the fluxes of carbon from soils to the atmosphere and in turn the stocks of soil carbon.},

Pre, post, and follow-up surveys were used to determine the differences in knowledge gained and retained by students that received direct instruction from their science teacher, and by those who received equivalent content instruction from outside presenters. The teacher participant also completed a survey on her experience with the researcher-designed lesson plans. Students' results on the surveys were compared to results from a control group with no intervention. The teacher-based setting resulted in significantly higher knowledge gain, although no difference was found between the groups' rate of knowledge decline thereafter. Highest gains in knowledge were for the carbon cycle and the human impacts topic, followed by understanding the difference between climate and weather. The students and teacher alike appeared to struggle with the topic of global warming and the greenhouse effect. The research suggests that with the appropriate background information the classroom teacher is likely to be more effective at conveying the science of climate change, particularly when it is taught through an understanding of the carbon cycle and its human impacts. It also suggests that those non-governmental organizations engaged in climate change education might be better served by investing their limited resources in the development of learning materials and subsequent professional development for teachers rather than focusing on in-school presentations.}

A constructed database of the ca. 2,100 cited experiments and simulations in the five ARs was ana‐ lyzed with respect to impacts on yields via crop type, region, and whether adaptation was included. Quantitative data on impacts and adaptation in livestock farming have been extremely scarce in the ARs. The main conclusions from impact and adapta‐ tion are that crop yields will decline, but that responses have large statistical vari‐ ation. Mitigation assessments in the ARs have used both bottom‐up and top‐down methods but need better to link emissions and their mitigation with food production and security. Relevant policy options have become broader in later ARs and included more of the social and nonproduction aspects of food security. Our overall conclu‐ sion is that agriculture and food security, which are two of the most central, criti‐ cal, and imminent issues in climate change, have been dealt with an unfocussed and inconsistent manner between the IPCC five ARs. This is partly a result of not only agriculture spanning two IPCC working groups but also the very strong focus on pro‐ jections from computer crop simulation modeling. For the future, we suggest a need to examine interactions between themes such as crop resource use efficiencies and to include all production and nonproduction aspects of food security in future roles for integrated assessment models.},

At the organo–mineral interface, 88\% (72–92\%) and 33\% (16–53\%) enrichment of N and oxidized C, respectively, indicate different stabilization processes than at organo–organic interfaces. However, N enrichment at both interface types points towards the importance of N-rich residues for greater C sequestration.},

  abstract = {© 2018 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd. We evaluated the "4 per 1000" initiative for increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) by analysing rates of SOC increase in treatments in 16 long-term experiments in southeast United Kingdom. The initiative sets a goal for SOC stock to increase by 4‰ per year in the 0-40 cm soil depth, continued over 20 years. Our experiments, on three soil types, provided 114 treatment comparisons over 7-157 years. Treatments included organic additions (incorporated by inversion ploughing), N fertilizers, introducing pasture leys into continuous arable systems, and converting arable land to woodland. In 65\% of cases, SOC increases occurred at {$>$} 7‰ per year in the 0-23 cm depth, approximately equivalent to 4‰ per year in the 0-40 cm depth. In the two longest running experiments ( {$>$} 150 years), annual farmyard manure (FYM) applications at 35 t fresh material per hectare (equivalent to approx. 3.2 t organic C/ha/year) gave SOC increases of 18‰ and 43‰ per year in the 23 cm depth during the first 20 years. Increases exceeding 7‰ per year continued for 40-60 years. In other experiments, with FYM applied at lower rates or not every year, there were increases of 3‰-8‰ per year over several decades. Other treatments gave increases between zero and 19‰ per year over various periods. We conclude that there are severe limitations to achieving the "4 per 1000" goal in practical agriculture over large areas. The reasons include (1) farmers not having the necessary resources (e.g. insufficient manure); (2) some, though not all, practices favouring SOC already widely adopted; (3) practices uneconomic for farmers-potentially overcome by changes in regulations or subsidies; (4) practices undesirable for global food security. We suggest it is more realistic to promote practices for increasing SOC based on improving soil quality and functioning as small increases can have disproportionately large beneficial impacts, though not necessarily translating into increased crop yield.},

  abstract = {Forests mitigate climate change by sequestering CO2 from the atmosphere and accumulating it in biomass storage pools. However, in dry conifer forests, fire occasionally returns large quantities of CO2 to the atmosphere. Both the total amount of carbon stored and its susceptibility to loss may be altered by post-fire land management strategies. Forest managers face a great challenge when asked to manage these lands for C sequestration and simultaneously reduce fire hazard. The objective of our study was to understand how differing post-fire management strategies affect C sequestration and the size of storage pools in the 10years after a wildfire in a Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forest. Post-fire management regimes included: (1) salvage-logged, planted, and intensively managed plantation (IM); (2) salvage-logged and planted (SP); (3) no salvage (NS); and (4) green canopy (GC), where fire burned through, but 95\% of the overstory trees survived. Carbon sequestration and storage were estimated from measurements of individual ecosystem carbon pools. These pools included: aboveground trees, saplings, snags, stumps, and understory, coarse wood and fine wood, duff, and soil. We found total ecosystem carbon storage was 282±15Mgha-1 of C in the NS treatment, 206±31Mgha-1 in the GC, 137±13Mgha-1 in the SP, and 101±15Mgha-1 in the IM treatment. There were no significant treatment differences in C storage among the pools that would constitute labile/fine fuels, but there were differences in recalcitrant (coarse fuel) C pools. The greatest C storage in recalcitrant C pools was 258±10Mgha-1 in the NS and 197±30Mgha-1 in the GC treatments. Post-fire carbon sequestration rates were 1.6±0.7Mgha-1year-1 of C in the GC, 0.7±0.3Mgha-1year-1 in the SP, 0.5±0.1Mgha-1year-1 in the NS, and 0.5±0.1Mgha-1year-1 in the IM treatments, but these differences were not statistically significant. Tree carbon sequestration rates were highest in the GC treatment and lowest in the NS treatment. Overall, our results suggest that a mature green-canopy stand provides most benefit in terms of C sequestration, wildfire resilience, and other ecosystem services at a point 10years after severe wildfire. For forests that suffer high fire mortality, unsalvaged (NS) stands will retain the most carbon onsite. © 2012.},

But these claims ignore a large body of experimental evidence showing that the quantity of additional organic carbon in soil under no-till is relatively small: in large part apparent increases result from an altered depth distribution. The larger concentration near the surface in no-till is generally beneficial for soil properties that often, though not always, translate into improved crop growth. In many regions where no-till is practised it is common for soil to be cultivated conventionally every few years for a range of agronomic reasons, so any soil carbon benefit is then lost. We argue that no-till is beneficial for soil quality and adaptation of agriculture to climate change, but its role in mitigation is widely overstated.},

  abstract = {Forest age, which is affected by stand-replacing ecosystem disturbances (such as forest fires, harvesting, or insects), plays a distinguishing role in determining the distribution of carbon (C) pools and fluxes in different forested ecosystems. In this synthesis, net primary productivity (NPP), net ecosystem productivity (NEP), and five pools of C (living biomass, coarse woody debris, organic soil horizons, soil, and total ecosystem) are summarized by age class for tropical, temperate, and boreal forest biomes. Estimates of variability in NPP, NEP, and C pools are provided for each biome-age class combination and the sources of variability are discussed. Aggregated biome-level estimates of NPP and NEP were higher in intermediate-aged forests (e.g., 30-120 years), while older forests (e.g., {$>$}120 years) were generally less productive. The mean NEP in the youngest forests (0-10 years) was negative (source to the atmosphere) in both boreal and temperate biomes (-0.1 and -1.9 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively). Forest age is a highly significant source of variability in NEP at the biome scale; for example, mean temperate forest NEP was -1.9, 4.5, 2.4, 1.9 and 1.7 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) across five age classes (0-10, 11-30, 31-70, 71-120, 121-200 years, respectively). In general, median NPP and NEP are strongly correlated (R-2=0.83) across all biomes and age classes, with the exception of the youngest temperate forests. Using the information gained from calculating the summary statistics for NPP and NEP, we calculated heterotrophic soil respiration (R-h) for each age class in each biome. The mean R-h was high in the youngest temperate age class (9.7 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) and declined with age, implying that forest ecosystem respiration peaks when forests are young, not old. With notable exceptions, carbon pool sizes increased with age in all biomes, including soil C. Age trends in C cycling and storage are very apparent in all three biomes and it is clear that a better understanding of how forest age and disturbance history interact will greatly improve our fundamental knowledge of the terrestrial C cycle.},

  abstract = {Use of a single factor for converting soil organic carbon to soil organic matter is challenged. The basis for this challenge arises from four sources: the original papers published in the nineteenth century, empirical studies published throughout the twentieth century, theoretical considerations of organic matter composition, and a consideration of what led to the popularity and general acceptance of the conventional factor. The conventional factor of 1.724, based on the assumption that soil organic matter contains 58\% carbon, applies only to some soils or only to particular components of soil organic matter. Studies published since the end of the nineteenth century have consistently shown that the factor of 1.724 is too low for most soils. In a review of previously published data, the median value for the conversion factor was found to be 1.9 from empirical studies and 2 from more theoretical considerations. A factor of 2, based on the assumption that organic matter is 50\% carbon, would in almost all cases be more accurate than the conventional factor of 1.724. A consideration of the possible variation in organic matter composition predicts a range of factor values between 1.4 and 2.5, a range that is narrower than empirical results at least in part because of the interaction between the methods used to estimate organic matter and soil composition. Convenience, authority, and tradition rather than strength of evidence are in large part responsible for the widespread acceptance of the conventional factor. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The response of whole-soil profiles to warming has not been tested in situ. In a deep warming experiment in mineral soil, we found that CO2 production from all soil depths increased with 4°C warming; annual soil respiration increased by 34 to 37\%. All depths responded to warming with similar temperature sensitivities, driven by decomposition of decadal-aged carbon. Whole-soil warming reveals a larger soil respiration response than many in situ experiments (most of which only warm the surface soil) and models. [1]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aal1319},

The work wants to propose a non-linear and multivariate computational approach to predict soil textural data and surficial stoniness based on ??-spectroscopy. The ??-spectroscopy survey was performed in heterogeneous soils in terms of parent material, pedogenesis, morphology, coarse material and moisture content. The ??-radiometrics survey was performed by "The Mole" sensor (The Netherlands) and ??-ray spectra were analysed by a Full Spectrum Analysis. 70 experimental points were described and classified according to parent material and surficial stoniness. The 70 experimental sites were also sampled during the ??-ray survey and analysed for soil texture and moisture content. An explorative PCA in the experimental points, based on the ??-ray data and the elevation, showed 3 groups of cases, relating to the three groups of bedrock (i) calcareous flysch, (ii) feldspathic sandstone, and (iii) other lithologies, namely marly-shales, marine and fluvio-lacustrine deposits. Two machine learning models were used to predict sand, clay and surficial stoniness. The models were Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). An independent validation set of 20 soil samples was used to check the accuracy of the prediction models. Both SVM and ANN showed good prediction accuracy for sand and clay, although SVM showed the lowest errors. Both models showed lower accuracy for stoniness prediction, mainly due to high prediction errors in several sampling points. Probably, the high errors in stoniness prediction were due the strong heterogeneity of rock types and mineralogy. However, prediction model of stoniness spatial variability is very important in order to an adequate farming management. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Soils represent a very complex material where mineral, organic and biological components interact together to form a large 'biogeochemical interface'. In order to study this complex interface in a simplified system, a so-called 'artificial soil' incubation experiment was carried out. This experiment was used here specifically to study the effect of microbial activity and mineral interactions on the aggregation occurring during incubation. Artificial soils with different mineral composition but the same texture, were composed of well-defined model materials. The materials considered were quartz, illite, montmorillonite, ferrihydrite, boehmite and charcoal, manure as an organic matter (OM) source and a microbial inoculum extracted from a natural arable topsoil. The artificial soils were incubated for 3 to 18months in the dark, under constant temperature and water content. The pH, organic carbon (OC) and nitrogen content, extractable Fe, Al and Si of the incubated artificial soils were measured, and the amount of macroaggregates{$>$}2mm was determined by sieving. Density fractionation was performed at densities of 1.8 and 2.4gcm -3 to separate particulate OM, organo-mineral associates and the mineral fraction. The specific surface area (SSA) of the organo-mineral associate fraction and the amount of OC associated with organo-mineral associates and minerals was determined. The SSA of the model materials and the artificial soils at the start of incubation was determined by BET-N 2. The artificial soils developed quickly and CO 2 respiration occurred during the entire 18month incubation time. The actual SSA of the 'soils' was significantly lower than the sum of the SSA of the pure model materials indicating that occlusion of mineral surfaces by interaction between OM and minerals occurred almost immediately after incubation started. Macroaggregates and organo-mineral associates were formed within 3months of incubation. Macroaggregation decreased after 12months of incubation probably due to decreasing biological activity. The turnover of macroaggregates and continuing formation of organo-mineral associates was consistent with the aggregate hierarchy model. Less macroaggregation was observed in the soil where no clay mineral was present, indicating that clay minerals were important for the formation of macroaggregates. Ferrihydrite and boehmite did not affect the aggregation or formation of organo-mineral associates in this experiment. The results of density fractionation indicate that OM was mainly associated with the clay minerals, probably due to the neutral pH of the artificial soils, leading to a low or negative surface charge of the oxides. The artificial soil incubation experiment showed that interface development and the building of macroaggregates and organo-mineral associates took place within a relatively short time scale. It offers a valuable model where the formation and interactions of soil properties and processes can be studied in a well-defined system. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Interactions between organic matter (OM), minerals and charcoal may play an important role in the development and stabilization of OM in soils. However, these interactions are difficult to characterize in natural soils, which are usually very complex systems with unknown initial conditions. We developed so-called 'artificial soils' with a texture and OM content similar to natural arable soils that were incubated up to 18 months. The aim was to determine the turnover and development of OM with incubation time, and to establish the effect of mineral composition and charcoal presence on organic carbon (OC) and N distribution and properties. Artificial soils were composed of quartz, manure as OM source and a microbial community extracted from a natural arable soil, with 8 different mixtures of montmorillonite, illite, ferrihydrite, boehmite and charcoal. We determined C and N particle size distribution with time and used solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and acid hydrolysis to determine the development of OM composition. The CO2 respiration rate and distribution of OC and N with particle size was similar for all artificial soil compositions. OC and N accumulated in the {$<$}20μm fraction over time and approximately 50\% of coarse ({$>$}200μm) particulate OM was lost after 18 months of incubation. 13C NMR spectroscopy indicated accumulation of protein-rich OC in the {$<$}20μm fraction, likely in the form of microbially produced substances. Acid hydrolysis showed a higher content of non-hydrolysable N in the mixtures containing clay minerals, indicating that some of the nitrogen present was strongly bound to phylosilicate surfaces. Ferrihydrite did not have any effect on non-hydrolysable N. From this, it can be concluded that in the artificial soils, clay minerals were more important than metal-oxides for the binding of nitrogen and OC. Overall, the artificial soils developed similarly to incubation experiments with natural soils, and were therefore a valuable model system where the effect of specific components on the development and turnover of soil OM could be determined under simplified conditions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The SOC and N stocks were assessed on a Mollisol in central Ohio in an 8-year-old tillage experiment as well as under two relatively undisturbed land uses; a secondary forest and a pasture on the same soil type. Cropped systems had 51??4 (equiv. mass) Mg ha-1 lower SOC and lower 3.5??0.3 (equiv. mass) Mg ha-1 N in the top 30 cm soil layer than under forest. Being a secondary forest, the loss in SOC and N stocks by cultivation may have been even more than these reported herein. No differences among systems were detected below this depth. The SOC stock in the pasture treatment was 29??3 Mg ha-1 greater in the top 10 cm layer than in cultivated soils, but was similar to those under forest and no-till (NT). Among tillage practices (plow, chisel and NT) only the 0-5 cm soil layer under NT exhibited higher SOC and N concentrations. An analysis of the literature of NT effect on SOC stocks, using meta-analysis, suggested that NT would have an overall positive effect on SOC sequestration rate but with a greater variability of what was previously reported. The average sequestration rate of NT was 330 kg SOC ha-1 year-1 with a 95\% confidence interval ranging from 47 to 620 kg SOC ha-1 year-1. There was no effect of soil texture or crop rotation on the SOC sequestration rate that could explain this variability. The conversion factor for SOC stock changes from plow to NT was equal to 1.04. This suggests that the complex mechanisms and pathways of SOC accrual warrant a cautious approach when generalizing the beneficial changes of NT on SOC stocks. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

We developed two analytical procedures to separate the effects of soil temperature and moisture, based on continuous measurements of the CO2 efflux, temperature and moisture of the soil at a ponderosa pine plantation in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California, from May 1998 to August 1999. We found that the combined effects of temperature and moisture on the seasonal variation of soil CO2 efflux could be effectively separated and represented with the product of a temperature term and a moisture term. The relationship between soil CO2 efflux and temperature could be well described using a power function. This relationship was modified by soil moisture which affects only the coefficient, but not the exponent, of the power function. We also found that when soil moisture was held constant, the temperature effect explained 82\% of the temporal variation in CO2 efflux of the soil. Similarly, when temperature was held constant, the moisture effects explained 84\% of the variation. Temperature and moisture together explained 89\% of the total temporal variations in soil CO2 efflux. A multiplicative formulation with power functions representing both temperature and moisture dependences was recommended for modeling soil CO2 efflux. This formulation can be used to model the seasonal trend of soil CO2 efflux of the forest based on temperature and moisture, two key variables influenced by climate change and management practices.},

Global estimates of inorganic carbon range from 700 to 900 Pg as carbonates stored in soils, representing a significant potential source of CO2 to the atmosphere. While previous studies have focused on the total CO2 efflux from the soil, our goal was to identify the various sources and their contribution to total CO2 emissions, by measuring the isotopic signature of the CO2 emitted from the soil. Calcareous Luvisolic silt loam soil samples were obtained from conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) plots in southern Ontario, Canada. Soil samples (root- and residue-free) were laboratory-incubated for 14 d and the isotopic signature of the CO2 (d13CCO2) released was analyzed using isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Isotopic measurement was essential in quantifying the abiotic CO2 production from carbonates, due to the unique d13C signature of carbonates and soil organic matter. A two-end member mixing model was used to estimate the proportion of CO2 evolved from soil carbonates and soil organic matter decomposition. Analysis of emitted CO2 collected after the 14-d incubation indicate that the proportion of CO2 originating from soil inorganic carbon was 62 to 74\% for CT soil samples, and 64 to 80\% for NT soil samples. Further work is recommended in the quantification of CO2 emissions from calcareous soils, and to determine the transferability of laboratory results to field studies.},

  abstract = {Measurements of atmospheric O 2 and CO 2 concentrations serve as a widely used means to partition global land and ocean carbon sinks. Interpretation of these measurements has assumed that the terrestria l biosphere contributes to changing O 2 levels by either expanding or contracting in size, and thus serving as either a carbon sink or source (and conversely as either an oxygen source or sink). Here, we show how changes in atmospheric O 2 can also occur if carbon within the terrestrial biosphere becomes more reduced or more oxidized, even with a constant carbon pool. At a global scale, we hypothesize that increasing levels of disturbance within many biomes has favored plant functional types with lower oxidative ratios and that this has caused carbon within the terrestrial biosphere to become increasingly more oxidized over a period of decades. Accounting for this mechanism in the global atmospheric O 2 budget may require a small increase in the size of the land carbon sink. In a scenario based on the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach model, a cumulative decrease in the oxidative ratio of net primary production (NPP) (moles of O 2 produced per mole of CO 2 fixed in NPP) by 0.01 over a period of 100 years would create an O 2 disequilibrium of 0.0017 and require an increased land carbon sink of 0.1 PgCyr 1 to balance global atmospheric O 2 and CO 2 budgets. At present, however, it is challenging to directly measure the oxidative ratio of terrestrial ecosystem exchange and even more difficult to detect a disequilibrium caused by a changing oxidative ratio of NPP.

  abstract = {Uncertainty about the effects of climate change on terrestrial soil organic C stocks has generated interest in clarifying the processes that underlie soil C dynamics. We investigated the role of soil mineral- ogy and aggregate stability as key variables controlling soil C dynamics in a California conifer forest. We characterized soils derived from granite (GR) and mixed andesite-granite (AN) parent materials from similar forest conditions. Granite and AN soils contained similar clay mineral assemblages as determined by x-ray diffraction (XRD), domi- nated by vermiculite, hydroxy-interlayered vermiculite (HIV), kaolin- ite, and gibbsite. However, AN soils contained significantly more Al in Al-humus complexes (6.2 vs. 3.3 kg m⫺2 ) and more crystalline and short-range order (SRO) Fe oxyhydroxides (30.6 vs. 16.8 kg m⫺2 ) than GR soils. Andesite-granite pedons contained nearly 50\% more C relative to GR soils (22.8 vs. 15.0 kg m⫺2 ). Distribution of C within density and aggregate fractions (free, occluded, and mineral associated C) varied significantly between AN and GR soils. In particular, AN soils had at least twice as much mineral associated C relative to GR soils in all horizons. Based on 14 C measurements, occluded C mean residence time (MRT) ⬎ mineral C ⬎ free C in both soil types, suggesting a significant role for aggregate C protection in controlling soil C turnover. We found highly significant, positive correlations between Al-humus complexes, SRO Al minerals, and total C content. We suggest that a combination of aggregate protection and organo- mineral association with Al-humus complexes and SRO Al minerals control the variation in soil C dynamics in these systems.},

Temperate forest biomes contain approximately 10\% of global soil carbon (C) stocks and therefore any change in their distribution may have significant impacts on terrestrial C budgets. Using the Sierra Nevada as a model system for temperate forest soils, we examined the effects of temperature and soil mineralogy on soil C mineralization. We incubated soils from three conifer biomes dominated by ponderosa pine (PP), white fir (WF), and red fir (RF) tree species, on granite (GR), basalt (BS), and andesite (AN) parent materials, at three temperatures (12.5°C, 7.5°C, 5.0°C). AN soils were dominated by noncrystalline materials (allophane, Al-humus complexes), GR soils by crystalline minerals (kaolinite, vermiculite), and BS soils by a mix of crystalline and noncrystalline materials. Soil C mineralization (ranging from 1.9 to 34.6 [mg C (g soil C) -1 ] or 0.1 to .3 [mg C (g soil) -1 ]) differed significantly between parent materials in all biomes with a general pattern of AN {$<$} BS {$<$} GR. We found significant negative relationships between Fe-oxyhydroxides, Al-oxyhydroxides, and Al-humus complex content and soil C mineralization, suggesting mineral control of C mineralization. Modeled decomposition rates and mineralizable pool size increased with increasing temperature for all parent materials and biomes. Further, δ 13 C values of respired CO 2 suggest greater decomposition of recalcitrant soil C compounds with increasing temperature, indicating a shift in primary C source utilization with temperature. Our results demonstrate that soil mineralogy moderates soil C mineralization and that soil C response to temperature includes shifts in decomposition rates, mineralizable pool size, and primary C source utilization. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

The effects of environmental factors such as temperature, litter quality, and soil mineralogy on priming are not well understood. The objectives of this study were to determine the interaction of temperature and soil mineral assemblage on priming of temperate forest soil C. We incubated soils from three forest types (ponderosa pine, white fir, and red fir), on granite (GR), basalt (BS), and andesite (AN) parent materials at three temperatures (12.5, 7.5, and 5.0°C), with the addition of 13 C-labeled ponderosa pine litter.

The percentage of C derived from litter and soil C pools varied significandy by parent material and forest type. Andesite soils, dominated by short-range-oder (SRO) aluminosilicates demonstrated decreased priming relative to BS and GR soils across all forest types.

  abstract = {Temperate forest soil organic carbon (C) represents a significant pool of terrestrial C that may be released to the atmosphere as CO2 with predicted changes in climate. To address potential feedbacks between climate change and terrestrial C turnover, we quantified forest soil C response to litter type and temperature change as a function of soil parent material. We collected soils from three conifer forests dominated by ponderosa pine (PP; Pinus ponderosa Laws.); white fir [WF; Abies concolor (Gord. and Glend.) Lindl.]; and red fir (RF; Abies magnifica A. Murr.) from each of three parent materials, granite (GR), basalt (BS), and andesite (AN) in the Sierra Nevada of California. Field soils were incubated at their mean annual soil temperature (MAST), with addition of native C-13-labeled litter to characterize soil C mineralization under native climate conditions. Further, we incubated WF soils at PP MAST with C-13-labeled PP litter, and RF soils at WF MAST with C-13-labeled WF litter to simulate a migration of MAST and litter type, and associated change in litter quality, up-elevation in response to predicted climate warming. Results indicated that total CO2 and percent of CO2 derived from soil C varied significantly by parent material, following the pattern of GR {$>$} BS {$>$} AN. Regression analyses indicated interactive control of C mineralization by litter type and soil minerals. Soils with high short-range-order (SRO) mineral content exhibited little response to varying litter type, whereas PP litter enriched in acid-soluble components promoted a substantial increase of extant soil C mineralization in soils of low SRO mineral content. Climate change conditions increased soil C mineralization greater than 200\% in WF forest soils. In contrast, little to no change in soil C mineralization was noted for the RF forest soils, suggesting an ecosystem-specific climate change response. The climate change response varied by parent material, where AN soils exhibited minimal change and GR and BS soils mineralized substantially greater soil C. This study corroborates the varied response in soil C mineralization by parent material and highlights how the soil mineral assemblage and litter type may interact to control conifer forest soil C response to climate change.},

The objective of this research was to quantify climatic controls of weathering and pedogenic processes on basalt-derived soils across an environmental gradient on the western slope of the Casacade Range of California, USA. We hypothesized that climate controls mineral neogenesis, with cool, moist conditions favoring formation of short-range-order (SRO) materials and warm, dry conditions favoring smectite, crystalline Fe-oxyhydroxides and kaolins. Four pedons were sampled across an elevation gradient (250-2500 m) having large variation in mean annual soil temperature (5-17 °C) and mean annual precipitation (750-1350 mm). The soil mineral assemblage was characterized by X-ray diffraction, selective dissolution, total elemental analysis and light microscopy. The degree of weathering and mineral assemblage exhibited a clear threshold at the permanent winter snowline (\$\textbackslash sim\$ 1200 m). Maximum soil development was noted just below the snowline with soils dominated by kaolinite and dehydrated halloysite, crystalline Fe-oxyhydroxides (48 kg m - 2 ), extensive loss of cations (chemical index of alteration, CIA {$>$} 95\%) and clay accumulation (447 kg m - 2 ). In contrast, the high elevation snow-dominated pedons displayed less intense weathering (e.g., CIA {$<$} 75\% and clay {$<$} 25 kg m - 2 ) and a mineral assemblage dominated by primary minerals and SRO materials. The cool, moist conditions of mid-altitude (\$\textbackslash sim\$ 1600 m) soils appear optimum for the formation and preservation of SRO materials (allophane = 30 kg m - 2 ). All pedons contained hydroxy-Al interlayered smectite that was either neogenic or derived from eolian minerals. With increasing elevation soil development followed Alfisols → Ultisols → Andisols → Entisols, in agreement with similar gradients in the California Sierra Nevada.

The objective of this research was to quantify mineral transformation on andesitic lahar across an environmental gradient on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada of California. We hypothesized that the dominance of short-range-order (SRO) materials would increase with increasing elevation as precipitation increased and temperatures decreased. Seven pedons were sampled across an elevation gradient (150-2800 m) having large variations in mean annual soil temperature (3-17°C) and mean annual precipitation (45-150 cm). The soil mineral assemblage was characterized by x-ray diffraction, selective dissolution, total elemental analysis, and microprobe analysis. Weathering and soil development displayed maxima in the zone just below the permanent winter snowline (∼1590 m), with a sharp decrease at higher elevations. Rainfall-dominated soils at lower elevations had a clay fraction dominated by kaolin. In the snowfall-dominated zone, SRO (allophane and imogolite) dominated the clay fraction, except for the soils in the cryic soil temperature regime, where interlayered 2:1 layer silicates dominated. The 2:1 mineral is probably inherited, based on the presence of a chlorite-like mineral in the andesite parent material. With increasing elevation, soil development followed the order Mollisols → Alfisols → Ultisols → Andisols → Inceptisols.

Improved quantification of the factors controlling soil organic matter (SOM) stabilization at continental to global scales is needed to inform projections of the largest actively cycling terrestrial carbon pool on Earth, and its response to environmental change. Biogeochemical models rely almost exclusively on clay content to modify rates of SOM turnover and fluxes of climate-active CO2 to the atmosphere. Emerging conceptual understanding, however, suggests other soil physicochemical properties may predict SOM stabilization better than clay content. We addressed this discrepancy by synthesizing data from over 5,500 soil profiles spanning continental scale environmental gradients. Here, we demonstrate that other physicochemical parameters are much stronger predictors of SOM content, with clay content having relatively little explanatory power. We show that exchangeable calcium strongly predicted SOM content in water-limited, alkaline soils, whereas with increasing moisture availability and acidity, iron- and aluminum-oxyhydroxides emerged as better predictors, demonstrating that the relative importance of SOM stabilization mechanisms scales with climate and acidity. These results highlight the urgent need to modify biogeochemical models to better reflect the role of soil physicochemical properties in SOM cycling.},

Here, we address this need by studying a matrix of forest ecosystems and soil parent materials with the objective of quantifying controls on the physical partitioning and residence time of soil organic carbon. We sampled soil profiles across a climate gradient on the western slope of the California Sierra Nevada, focusing on three distinct forest ecosystems dominated by ponderosa pine, white fir, or red fir, on three igneous parent materials that included granite, andesite, and basalt. Results indicated that short-range order mineral phases were the dominant factors accounting for the variation in soil carbon content and residence time. The results further suggested an interaction between ecosystem fire regime and the degree of soil weathering on the partitioning, chemical composition, and residence time of C in density separated soil physical fractions. These results suggest a link between the degree of soil weathering and C storage capacity, with a greater divergence in storage capacity and residence time in the Inceptisols, Entisols, and Andisols of the white fir and red fir ecosystems relative to minimal variation in the highly weathered Ultisols and Alfisols of the ponderosa pine ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Understanding the origin of the carbon (C) stabilised in soils is crucial in order to device management practices that will foster C accumulation in soils. The relative contributions to soil C pools of roots vs. shoots is one aspect that has been mostly overlooked, although it appears a key factor that drives the fate of plant tissue C either as mineralized CO(2) or as stabilized soil organic matter (SOM). Available studies on the subject consistently indicate that root C has a longer residence time in soil than shoot C. From the few studies with complete datasets, we estimated that the mean residence time in soils of root-derived C is 2.4 times that of shoot-derived C. Our analyses indicate that this value is biased neither by an underestimation of root contributions, as exudation was considered in the analysis, nor by a priming effect of shoot litter on SOM. Here, we discuss the main SOM stabilisation mechanisms with respect to their ability to specifically protect root-derived SOM. Comparing in situ and incubation experiments suggests that the higher chemical recalcitrance of root tissues as compared to that of shoots is responsible for only a small portion, i.e. about one fourth, of the difference in mean residence time in soils of root-derived vs. shoot-derived C. This suggests that SOM protection mechanisms other than chemical recalcitrance are also enhanced by root activities: (1) physico-chemical protection, especially in deeper horizons, (2) micrometer-scale physical protection through myccorhiza and root-hair activities, and (3) chemical interactions with metal ions. The impact of environmental conditions within deeper soil layers on root C stabilisation appear difficult to assess, but is likely, if anything, to further increase the ratio between the mean residence time of root vs. shoot C in soils. Future advances are expected from isotopic studies conducted at the molecular level, which will help unravel the fate of individual shoot and root compounds, such as cutins and suberins, throughout soil profiles.},

The objective of the present study was to determine C-turnover kinetics throughout the 1-m profile of a cultivated loam soil of the Paris basin, France. The soil 13C signature was determined to depths of 1.05 m in 32 replicated plots having received from 0 to 10 yr of maize after wheat. Above- and below-ground maize-residue biomass inputs were estimated throughout the 10-yr period. After 10 yr, maize-derived soil organic carbon (SOC) constituted about 10, 5, and 2\% of the total SOC at 15-, 50-, and 100-cm depths, respectively. About one-third of recently deposited maize-derived SOMpresent in the 1-m soil profile was retrieved below the Ap horizon. The ratios of maize-derived soil C to the cumulative maize above- and below-ground inputs over the 10-yr period averaged 17\% across the soil profile. This ratio was lower in the Ap horizon (i.e., 13\%) than in deeper soil horizons. Circumstantial evidences suggest that the distribution profile of recently deposited maizederived C was influenced by fine root activities, bioturbation, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) transport, the latter being substantiated by a high correlation (r2 = 0.86) between SOC contents and amorphous Fe + Al contents. In conclusion, our study stresses the need to take into account the full 1-m soil profile in C sequestration studies.},

Any future change in soil carbon stock resulting from the formation of pedogenic carbonates will be difficult to set in context because historical measurements or estimates of IC concentration and stock may not be available. In their article describing a database of soil carbon for the United Kingdom published in this journal, Bradley et al. [Soil Use and Management (2005) vol. 21, 363–369] only consider data for organic carbon (OC), despite the occurrence of IC-bearing calcareous soils across a substantial part of southern England. Robust techniques are required for establishing IC concentrations and stocks based on available data. We present linear regression models (R2 between 0.8 and 0.88) to estimate IC in topsoil based on total Ca and Al concentrations for soils over two groups of primary, carbonate-bearing parent materials across parts of southern and eastern England. By applying the regression models to geochemical survey data across the entire area (18 165 km2), we estimate IC concentrations on a regular 500-m grid by ordinary kriging. Using bulk density data from across the region, we estimate the total IC stock of soil (0–30 cm depth) in this area to be 186 MtC. This represents 15.5 and 5.5\% of the estimated total soil carbon stock (OC plus IC) across England and the UK, respectively, based on the data presented by Bradley et al.

  abstract = {The complex nature of climate change science poses special challenges for educators. Learners come to the classroom with prior knowledge on the topic, which serves as a foundation for further knowledge building, but can also pose barriers to conceptual change. Learners have existing mental models that may limit their perception and processing of conflicting information and prevent adoption of scientific conceptions. Instructional strategies that attempt conceptual change by simply provoking cognitive conflict have had limited success due to the importance of epistemological beliefs and motivation to the conceptual change process. The Mock Environment Summit course uses role-playing, argumentation and discussion to heighten epistemological awareness and motivation and thereby facilitate conceptual change. The pre/post-course concept map evaluation of students' knowledge about the science of global climate change reported here shows evidence of significant learning and conceptual change. Our study also provides useful information about gaps in knowledge and the types of misconceptions students are likely to have about this topic. Insight gained from this assessment study can be used to tailor the curriculum and enhance student progress towards more scientific conceptions of the problem. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {Over several decades, near infrared (NIR) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) has been shown to be extremely versatile for the rapid analysis of many agricultural materials including forages, foods and grains. More recently, mid-infrared (mid-IR) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and NIRS have come under intense scrutiny for their potential to provide a rapid method for the analysis of soil C, minerals and other soil parameters of interest. Research has demonstrated that for the determination of soil C, DRIFTS is often more accurate and produces more robust calibrations than NIRS when analyzing ground, dry soils under laboratory conditions. However, mid-IR spectra are known to be more affected by moisture and sample preparation than NIR. In reality, DRIFTS is not even considered feasible on samples containing high levels of moisture due to the strong water absorptions in the mid-IR, although the presence of water is also known to often degrade even NIR spectra and subsequent calibrations. While both techniques offer the potential for the analysis of soils on-site, and even in situ, many questions remain to be answered including: 1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of on-site as opposed to laboratory analysis? 2. What are the effects of moisture and particle size on accuracy if samples are to be analyzed on-site? 3. Which spectral range (mid-IR or NIR) is the most effective for in laboratory and/or on-site analysis? 4. Which analytes can be accurately analyzed by NIR and/or mid-IR spectroscopy? 5. What are the effects of different soil types and compositions on the entire process of calibration development? In addition, while DRIFTS has been shown to be advantageous in the laboratory, if samples need to be ground and dried, and instruments purged to obtain useable data, it may not be practical for on-site use. This review will try to answer some of these questions and show where the science stands and what needs to be done before NIRS or DRIFTS can be fully exploited for routine soil analysis.},

  abstract = {There has been an increasing interest in the use of mid-infrared spectroscopy for the quantitative analysis of soils. Understanding the spectral bands can be beneficial both for understanding the basis of the quantitative analysis and soil composition and structure in general. Unfortunately, at least from the standpoint of the organic composition of soils, the spectra of most soils are dominated by the spectra of inorganic fractions such as clays, silica, carbonates, etc. One method used to accentuate the signature of the organic fraction has been to ash soil samples and then use spectral subtraction, in theory leaving only the spectral signature of the organic fraction. The objective of this work was to investigate exactly how accurate/practical this procedure is and is derived from recent comments from reviewers. Results examining silt, clays, silica, calcium carbonate, soils and materials such as cellulose and lignin show that, without considerable prior knowledge of a soil sample, spectral interpretation in most regions of the mid-infrared is highly interpretive/subjective at best. While the region for CH absorptions (3000-2800cm -1) is free of interferences, except for carbonates which can be removed by acidification, and the region between 1750-1600cm -1 can be interpreted despite the presence of strong silica bands, interpretation of the remaining regions of the mid-infrared are deemed very subjective. This is largely, but not entirely, due to the fact that many types of clay undergo extreme spectral changes from ashing and materials with seemingly similar formulas such as kaolinite (Al 2Si 2O 5(OH) 4) and pyrophyllite (Al 2Si 4O 10(OH) 2) change differently when ashed. Thus unless one knows the exact clay/mineral composition of the soil in question and the effects of ashing on said clay/mineral, accurately interpreting the ash subtracted spectra is nearly impossible. Also, even subtracting silica was found to be difficult due to changing specular effects even with KBr diluted samples. From a practical standpoint, one must conclude that the routine use of ash subtraction is not practical for soils as too much needs to be known to judge the results. © 2012.},

  abstract = {Stabilization of soil organic carbon (SOC) against microbial decomposition depends on several soil properties, including the soil weathering stage and the mineralogy of parent material. As such, tropical SOC stabilization mechanisms likely differ from those in temperate soils due to contrasting soil development. To better understand these mechanisms, we investigated SOC dynamics at three soil depths under pristine tropical African mountain forest along a geochemical gradient from mafic to felsic and a topographic gradient covering plateau, slope and valley positions. To do so, we conducted a series of soil C fractionation experiments in combination with an analysis of the geochemical composition of soil and a sequential extraction of pedogenic oxides. Relationships between our target and predicting variables were investigated using a combination of regression analyses and dimension reduction. Here, we show that reactive secondary mineral phases drive SOC properties and stabilization mechanisms together with, and sometimes more strongly than, other mechanisms such as aggregation or C stabilization by clay content. Key mineral stabilization mechanisms for SOC were strongly related to soil geochemistry, differing across the study regions. These findings were independent of topography in the absence of detectable erosion processes. Instead, fluvial dynamics and changes in soil moisture conditions had a secondary control on SOC dynamics in valley positions, leading to higher SOC stocks there than at the non-valley positions. At several sites, we also detected fossil organic carbon (FOC), which is characterized by high C/N ratios and depletion of N. FOC constitutes up to 52.0g±g13.2g\% of total SOC stock in the C-depleted subsoil. Interestingly, total SOC stocks for these soils did not exceed those of sites without FOC. Additionally, FOC decreased strongly towards more shallow soil depths, indicating decomposability of FOC by microbial communities under more fertile conditions. Regression models, considering depth intervals of 0-10, 30-40 and 60-70gcm, showed that variables affiliated with soil weathering, parent material geochemistry and soil fertility, together with soil depth, explained up to 75g\% of the variability of SOC stocks and "14C. Furthermore, the same variables explain 44g\% of the variability in the relative abundance of C associated with microaggregates vs. free-silt- and-clay-associated C fractions. However, geochemical variables gained or retained importance for explaining SOC target variables when controlling for soil depth. We conclude that despite long-lasting weathering, geochemical properties of soil parent material leave a footprint in tropical soils that affects SOC stocks and mineral-related C stabilization mechanisms. While identified stabilization mechanisms and controls are similar to less weathered soils in other climate zones, their relative importance is markedly different in the tropical soils investigated.},

This article critically reviews the suitability ofcommonly used extractants (e.g. dithionite, oxalate and pyrophosphate) and the potentials and restrictions in their use for species identification and in soil classification. None ofthe commonly used extractants is completely selective and quantitative. The degree ofcompleteness differs between the extractants and depends on soil composition. Dithionite- based methods provide a ‘pseudo-total' content of pedogenic Fe oxides, as they are not always completely dissolved. Oxalate may attack further non-target species, releasing additional Al and Fe. Therefore, the extraction of Al and Fe exclusively from poorly crystalline species is not always guaranteed. As a consequence of dispersion of aggregates, pyrophosphate solubilises both mineral particles and metals from organic associations. Thus, quantification of species based on these extractions and their implementation in pedogenic thresholds may be questionable. Alternative extractants such as citrate–ascorbate and dithionite–citrate–oxalate could be used in addition, as applicable and reliable wet- chemical extractions will be still demanded for research and practical applications. The examination of the effectiveness and selectivity of wet-chemical extraction methods by spectroscopic techniques is recommended.},

  abstract = {Tower-based eddy covariance measurements of forest-atmosphere carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange from many sites around the world indicate that there is considerable year- to-year variation in net ecosystem exchange (NEE). Here, we use a statistical modeling approach to partition the interannual variability in NEE (and its component fluxes, ecosystem respiration, Reco, and gross photosynthesis, Pgross) into two main effects: variation in environmental drivers (air and soil temperature, solar radiation, vapor pressure deficit, and soil water content) and variation in the biotic response to this environmental forcing (as characterized by the model parameters). The model is applied to a 9-year data set fromtheHowlandAmeriFlux site, a spruce-dominated forest in Maine, USA. Gap-filled flux measurements at this site indicate that the forest has been seques- tering, on average, 190gCm2 yr1, with a range from 130 to 270gCm2 yr1. Our fitted model predicts somewhat more uptake (mean 270gCm2 yr1), but interannual variation is similar, and wavelet variance analyses indicate good agreement between tower measurements and model predictions across a wide range of timescales (hours to years). Associated with the interannual variation in NEE are clear differences among years in model parameters for both Reco and Pgross. Analysis of model predictions suggests that, at the annual time step, about 40\% of the variance in modeled NEE can be attributed to variation in environmental drivers, and 55\% to variation in the biotic response to this forcing.As model predictions are aggregated at longer timescales (from individual days to months to calendar year), variation in environmental drivers becomes progressively less important, and variation in the biotic response becomes progressively more important, in determining the modeled flux. There is a strong negative correlation between modeled annual Pgross and Reco (r50.93, P0.001); two possible explanations for this correlation are discussed. The correlation promotes homeostasis of NEE: the interannual variation in modeled NEE is substantially less than that for either Pgross or Reco},

  abstract = {Spring phenology is thought to exert a major influence on the carbon (C) balance of temperate and boreal ecosystems. We investigated this hypothesis using four spring onset phenological indicators in conjunction with surface-atmosphere CO(2) exchange data from the conifer-dominated Howland Forest and deciduous-dominated Harvard Forest AmeriFlux sites. All phenological measures, including CO(2) source-sink transition dates, could be well predicted on the basis of a simple two-parameter spring warming model, indicating good potential for improving the representation of phenological transitions and their dynamic responsiveness to climate variability in land surface models. The date at which canopy-scale photosynthetic capacity reached a threshold value of 12 micromol m(-2) s(-1) was better correlated with spring and annual flux integrals than were either deciduous or coniferous bud burst dates. For all phenological indicators, earlier spring onset consistently, but not always significantly, resulted in higher gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (RE) for both seasonal (spring months, April-June) and annual flux integrals. The increase in RE was less than that in GPP; depending on the phenological indicator used, a one-day advance in spring onset increased springtime net ecosystem productivity (NEP) by 2-4 g C m(-2) day(-1). In general, we could not detect significant differences between the two forest types in response to earlier spring, although the response to earlier spring was generally more pronounced for Harvard Forest than for Howland Forest, suggesting that future climate warming may favor deciduous species over coniferous species, at least in this region. The effect of earlier spring tended to be about twice as large when annual rather than springtime flux integrals were considered. This result is suggestive of both immediate and lagged effects of earlier spring onset on ecosystem C cycling, perhaps as a result of accelerated N cycling rates and cascading effects on N uptake, foliar N concentrations and photosynthetic capacity.},

Our study site is the spruce-dominated Howland Forest AmeriFlux site, in central Maine, USA. Our analysis focuses on: (1) full characterization of data uncertainties, and treatment of these uncertainties in the parameter estimation; (2) evaluation of how combinations of different data streams influence posterior parameter distributions and model uncertainties; and (3) comparison of model performance (in terms of both predicted fluxes and pool dynamics) during a 4-year calibration period (1997-2000) and a 4-year validation period ("forward run", 2001-2004). We find that woody biomass increment, and, to a lesser degree, soil respiration, measurements contribute to marked reductions in uncertainties in parameter estimates and model predictions as these provide orthogonal constraints to the tower NEE measurements. However, none of the data are effective at constraining fine root or soil C pool dynamics, suggesting that these should be targets for future measurement efforts. A key finding is that adding additional constraints not only reduces uncertainties (i.e., narrower confidence intervals) on model predictions, but at the same time also results in improved model predictions by greatly reducing bias associated with predictions during the forward run.},

The clearing of the world's forests, mainly for agricultural uses, releases large amounts of carbon to the atmosphere (up to 2 x 1015 gyr-1), much of which arises from the cultivation driving an accelerated decomposition of soil organic matter. Although the effects of cultivation on soil carbon are well studied, studies of soil-carbon recovery after cultivation are limited. Here we present a four-decade-long field study of carbon accumulation by pine ecosystems established on previously cultivated soils in South Carolina, USA. Newly accumulated carbon is tracked by its distinctive 14C signature, acquired around the onset of forest growth from thermonuclear bomb testing that nearly doubled atmospheric 14CO2 in the 1960s. Field data combined with model simulations indicate that the young aggrading forest rapidly incorporated bomb radiocarbon into the forest floor and the upper 60 cm of underlying mineral soil. By the 1990s, however, carbon accumulated only in forest biomass, forest floor, and the upper 7.5 cm of the mineral soil. Although the forest was a strong carbon sink, trees accounted for about 80\%, the forest floor 20\%, and mineral soil {$<$}1\%, of the carbon accretion. Despite high carbon inputs to the mineral soil, carbon sequestration was limited by rapid decomposition, facilitated by the coarse soil texture and low-activity clay mineralogy.},

Here we used measurements and a model of atmospheric radiocarbon (14C) to investigate the distribution and fluxes of atmospheric fossil fuel CO2 across the state of California. We sampled 14C in annual C3 grasses at 128 sites and used these measurements to test a regional model that simulated anthropogenic and ecosystem CO2 fluxes, transport in the atmosphere, and the resulting Δ14C of annual grasses (Δg). Average measured Δg levels in Los Angeles, San Francisco, the Central Valley, and the North Coast were 27.7 ± 20.0, 44.0 ± 10.9, 48.7 ± 1.9, and 59.9 ± 2.5‰, respectively, during the 2004-2005 growing season. Model predictions reproduced regional patterns reasonably well, with estimates of 27.6 ± 2.4, 39.4 ± 3.9, 46.8 ± 3.0, and 59.3 ± 0.2‰ for these same regions and corresponding to fossil fuel CO2 mixing ratios (Cf) of 13.7, 6.1, 4.8, and 0.3 ppm. Δg spatial heterogeneity in Los Angeles and San Francisco was higher in the measurements than in the predictions, probably from insufficient spatial resolution in the fossil fuel inventories (e.g., freeways are not explicitly included) and transport (e.g., within valleys). We used the model to predict monthly and annual transport patterns of fossil fuel-derived CO2 within and out of California. Fossil fuel CO2 emitted in Los Angeles and San Francisco was predicted to move into the Central Valley, raising Cf above that expected from local emissions alone. Annually, about 21, 39, 35, and 5\% of fossil fuel emissions leave the California airspace to the north, east, south, and west, respectively, with large seasonal variations in the proportions. Positive correlations between westward fluxes and Santa Ana wind conditions were observed. The southward fluxes over the Pacific Ocean were maintained in a relatively coherent flow within the marine boundary layer, while the eastward fluxes were more vertically dispersed. Our results indicate that state and continental scale atmospheric inversions need to consider areas where mixing ratio measurements are sparse (e.g., over the ocean to the south and west of California), transport within and across the marine boundary layer, and terrestrial boundary layer dynamics. Radiocarbon measurements can be very useful in constraining these estimates. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.},

The model predictions reasonably matched observed depth-resolved SOM and dissolved organic matter (DOM) stocks and fluxes, lignin content, and fungi to aerobic bacteria ratios. We performed a suite of sensitivity analyses under equilibrium and dynamic conditions to examine the role of dynamic sorption, microbial assimilation rates, and carbon inputs. To our knowledge, observations do not exist to fully test such a complicated model structure or to test the hypotheses used to explain observations of substantial storage of very old SOM below the rooting depth. Nevertheless, we demonstrated that a reasonable combination of sorption parameters, microbial biomass and necromass dynamics, and advective transport can match observations without resorting to an arbitrary depth-dependent decline in SOM turnover rates, as is often done. We conclude that, contrary to assertions derived from existing turnover time based model formulations, observed carbon content and Δ\textsuperscript{14}C vertical profiles are consistent with a representation of SOM consisting of carbon compounds with relatively fast reaction rates, vertical aqueous transport, and dynamic protection on mineral surfaces.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics in ecosystem-scale biogeochemical models have traditionally been simulated as immeasurable fluxes between conceptually defined pools. This greatly limits how empirical data can be used to improve model performance and reduce the uncertainty associated with their predictions of carbon (C) cycling. Recent advances in our understanding of the biogeochemical processes that govern SOM formation and persistence demand a new mathematical model with a structure built around key mechanisms and biogeochemically relevant pools. Here, we present one approach that aims to address this need. Our new model (MEMS v1.0) is developed from the Microbial Efficiency-Matrix Stabilization framework, which emphasizes the importance of linking the chemistry of organic matter inputs with efficiency of microbial processing and ultimately with the soil mineral matrix, when studying SOM formation and stabilization. Building on this framework, MEMS v1.0 is also capable of simulating the concept of C saturation and represents decomposition processes and mechanisms of physico-chemical stabilization to define SOM formation into four primary fractions. After describing the model in detail, we optimize four key parameters identified through a variance-based sensitivity analysis. Optimization employed soil fractionation data from 154 sites with diverse environmental conditions, directly equating mineral-associated organic matter and particulate organic matter fractions with corresponding model pools. Finally, model performance was evaluated using total topsoil (0-20cm) C data from 8192 forest and grassland sites across Europe. Despite the relative simplicity of the model, it was able to accurately capture general trends in soil C stocks across extensive gradients of temperature, precipitation, annual C inputs and soil texture. The novel approach that MEMS v1.0 takes to simulate SOM dynamics has the potential to improve our forecasts of how soils respond to management and environmental perturbation. Ensuring these forecasts are accurate is key to effectively informing policy that can address the sustainability of ecosystem services and help mitigate climate change.},

Here, we introduce a tractor-driven measuring chamber for on-the-go visible and near-infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (Vis–NIRS) meeting experimental and precision agriculture demands. A commercial full-range spectrometer operates in a closed dark chamber with artificial light. Sensor view angle, distance to soil, and illumination conditions were optimized. The mobile chamber was placed on drum rollers to flatten the ploughed and tilled soil surface and to minimize disturbances in Vis–NIR spectra by surface roughness. Prior to on-the-go spectra acquisition under field conditions, SOC prediction models for the soils under study were independently calibrated under variable moisture and roughness conditions. Driving at a tractor velocity of 3kmh−1 resulted in measuring spots of approximately 8cm length and 3cm width at 0.6m distance to one another in the direction of movement, delivering geo-referenced SOC concentrations at a sub-m spatial resolution. Gravel on the soil surface resulted in erratic extremes of predicted SOC concentrations, but these could be eliminated as outliers. The system was tested under field conditions on two long-term experiments at two different sites which revealed each a large span of SOC concentrations. On-the-go predicted SOC concentrations and those obtained from conventional plot-wise lab analyses were correlated with coefficients of determination of R2=0.65 and a standard error of 1.22g SOCkg−1. Further improvements, particularly in data processing, will enable a reliable proximal sensing on-the-go for precision agriculture purposes in the near future.},

The aim of our study was to test whether ERT was capable of detecting stones and tillage effects in a soil with a variable rock fragment content. Field experiments were conducted by performing a set of three two-dimensional (2D) resistivity tomographies across two management systems (tillage/no tillage) replicated twice on each transect, using dipole-dipole configuration and 0.25-m inter-electrode spacing. Soil texture, bulk density and water content were measured destructively. Greater average electrical resistivity (ER) was found in tilled plots, with maximum values of up to 1700 Ohm m. However, when the spatial correlation structure was considered in a mixed-effects model, no significant difference in ER was found between tilled and untilled plots. Empirical semivariograms showed less spatial continuity and more noise in tilled plots. Resistivity was strongly correlated with rock fragment content (r = 0.68), with greater average values in ploughed plots, which may possibly be linked to kinetic sieving after ploughing. ERT was able to identify the position of gravel lenses and was also sensitive to the presence of clay (r = −0.45): a linear trend in resistivity across the field (r = 0.80) was consistent with a decreasing clay content (r = −0.68). Resistivity was correlated with rock fragments, clay and an interaction variable (water × rock fragments). There was a poor fit for the tilled plot where resistivity peaks could be linked to the presence of voids, but their detection would have required a resolution greater than that which we adopted.},

The current paradigm is that processing of dissolved organic matter converges to recalcitrant molecules (those that resist degradation) of low molecular mass and high molecular diversity through biotic and abiotic processes. Here we demonstrate that the molecular composition and properties of dissolved organic matter continuously change during soil passage and propose that this reflects a continual shifting of its sources. Using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we studied the molecular changes of dissolved organic matter from the soil surface to 60 cm depth in 20 temperate grassland communities in soil type Eutric Fluvisol. Applying a semi-quantitative approach, we observed that plant-derived molecules were first broken down into molecules containing a large proportion of low-molecular-mass compounds. These low-molecular-mass compounds became less abundant during soil passage, whereas larger molecules, depleted in plant-related ligno-cellulosic structures, became more abundant. These findings indicate that the small plant-derived molecules were preferentially consumed by microorganisms and transformed into larger microbial-derived molecules. This suggests that dissolved organic matter is not intrinsically recalcitrant but instead persists in soil as a result of simultaneous consumption, transformation and formation.},

However, recent studies in other soil types have concluded that little O horizon DOM reaches the subsoil directly. We investigated whether c derived from O horizons contributes to deep-soil c stores in six Spodosol profiles under coniferous (red pine) or deciduous (sugar maple) forests. We used spectro- scopic, stable-isotope and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy analysis of DOM and solid phase soil samples to assess whether O horizon c was transported directly to deep soil horizons or had been exchanged with mineral soil organic matter (SOM) pools. All three approaches indicated that O horizons are the source of the majority of DOM entering B horizons, with little contribution from desorbed SOM. Despite a greater stock of O horizon c in red pine stands, there was no difference between forest types in the quantity of c delivered to B horizons (18 g c m–2 y–1). However, c derived from O horizons accounted for \$\textbackslash sim\$95\% of the c entering B horizons in sugar maple stands, but only \$\textbackslash sim\$80\% in red pine stands. Molecular analy- sis of DOM and SOM also showed a greater resemblance of B horizon SOM to DOM in sugar maple stands; however, it also clearly indicated the impor- tance of microbial processing of input c in the formation of B horizon SOM. Our results demonstrate the strong connection between O horizons and deep soil c stocks in these sandy Spodosols and indicate that future changes in the quantity or quality of DOM entering the mineral soil have the potential to alter the delivery of surface c to depth.},

  abstract = {The study of changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks as a result of land use or climate change requires sound criteria to compare SOC stocks in different plots. Just comparing SOC stored down to a standard depth (often, 30cm) is prone to errors, owing to the changes in soil bulk density due to shifts in SOC content or the soil compaction due to heavy machinery. To solve this problem several approaches have been suggested. Jenkinson proposed in 1971 the concept of ‘equivalent soil depth', the depth to which a soil should be sampled to reach a certain amount of fine mineral earth. Here we present a procedure which combines that concept with the modern cumulative coordinates approach (CCA). Our method involves sampling soils down to a given depth (30cm) with a volumetric core sampler which maintains the profile structure, and divide the obtained core in depth layers (0–5, 5–15 and 15–30cm). Each layer is studied separately for its stone and gravel content, fine earth ({$<$}2mm) and coarse organic fragments. From these data we calculate the cumulative (with depth) amounts of fine earth ({$<$}2mm), soil organic carbon (SOC), and fine mineral earth (FME), i.e. the fine earth corrected for organic matter. Then, SOC and FME are plotted together and fitted to a double-exponential equation, to obtain the amount of SOC (kgm−2) accumulated in the uppermost Y kgm−2 of FME. As an example, we apply this approach to the comparison of SOC stocks in four plots differing in land use (crop, old forest, and recent pine stands), and also as to their stoniness and bulk density. Essentially, instead of comparing SOC stocks on a depth basis — amount of C stored in the uppermost Y cm of soil, for instance 30cm — we propose to compare SOC stocks on a fine mineral earth basis — amount of C stored by the uppermost Y kgm−2 of FME. The value we propose is Y=300kgm−2 of FME. Such an approach automatically corrects for the compression or expansion of soil due to heavy machinery, or the changes in bulk density due to the shifts in SOC content, thus making contrasting plots directly comparable. It is less clear, nevertheless, the usefulness of CCAs to compare SOC stocks in plots strongly differing as to their stoniness.},

  abstract = {© 2017, The Author(s). Soils play an essential role in the global cycling of carbon and understanding the stabilisation mechanisms behind the preservation of soil organic carbon (SOC) pools is of globally recognised significance. Until recently, research into SOC stabilisation has predominantly focused on acidic soil environments and the interactions between SOC and aluminium (Al) or iron (Fe). The interactions between SOC and calcium (Ca) have typically received less attention, with fewer studies conducted in alkaline soils. Although it has widely been established that exchangeable Ca (CaExch) positively correlates with SOC concentration and its resistance to oxidation, the exact mechanisms behind this relationship remain largely unidentified. This synthesis paper critically assesses available evidence on the potential role of Ca in the stabilisation of SOC and identifies research topics that warrant further investigation. Contrary to the common view of the chemistry of base cations in soils, chemical modelling indicates that Ca2+ can readily exchange its hydration shell and create inner sphere complexes with organic functional groups. This review therefore argues that both inner- and outer-sphere bridging by Ca2+ can play an active role in the stabilisation of SOC. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) can influence occluded SOC stability through its role in the stabilisation of aggregates; however, it could also play an unaccounted role in the direct sorption and inclusion of SOC. Finally, this review highlights the importance of pH as a potential predictor of SOC stabilisation mechanisms mediated by Al- or Fe- to Ca, and their respective effects on SOC dynamics.},

  abstract = {Soil bulk density (rho(b)) is required to estimate, evaluate, and calculate many physical soil properties and processes and is essential to convert data from weight-based to volume- and area-related data. One of the dominating factors changing rho(b) is the soil's organic matter (SOM) concentration that alters the soil's compressibility; rho(b) is an important soil structure attribute. Currently, no parameter for characterizing soil compactness giving directly comparable values for all soils is available. Therefore, our aim was to develop a general approach to calculate the effect of SOM concentration on rho(b) that would be universally valid for soils different in their genesis, compaction, and type of land use. To describe the effect of SOM on rho(b) mathematically, we used a nonlinear regression model that was parameterized and validated using published data from experiments where SOM concentration was the main rho(b)-affecting factor (long-term fertilization and proctor experiments, wetlands, reclaimed soils, and volcanic soils). To obtain a standardized parameter describing the present compaction status of a site, we introduced the standardized bulk density s rho(b). Mathematically, s rho(b) is the intercept parameter of the used nonlinear regression model, and ranged between 0.7 and 2.1 Mg m(-3) and was very simple to estimate. Another distinct advantage of this novel concept is that only one representative pair of rho(b) and SOM has to be known to calculate s rho(b) as well as the bulk densities corresponding to other SOM concentrations measured on the site. This concept might also be helpful for identifying similar universal approaches to standardize the effect of other rho(b) affecting parameters (e.g., texture, soil depth, tillage regime), however, reassessed from the SOM effect.},

  abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) stabilisation on tropical sloping land can be influenced by slash burning and erosion processes. However, information on the behaviour of potentially stable components of organic matter on burned sites is scarce. This study is focused on organic matter soluble after demineralisation of the samples with hydrofluoric acid (HF soluble) and organic matter remaining after hydrolysis with hydrochloric acid (HCl resistant), which are both part of the potentially stabile OM fraction in tropical soils. The objective was to examine their contribution to carbon stabilisation along a toposequence of soil profiles sampled in a small cultivated catchment in Northern Laos with slash burning as common agricultural practice. Bulk soil as well as residues after acid hydrolysis using HCl have been analysed for chemical composition and mean residence time of SOM. The tropical soils showed similar amounts of HF soluble and HCl resistant OC, representing between 20 and 60\% of the total OC of the soils. OC stabilisation at the sites is chiefly determined by mineral interactions as shown by the good correlations of the clay and the HF soluble OC contents with 14C activity. Analysis of the chemical structure by solid state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13C CPMAS NMR) showed that aromatic carbon contributes substantially to HCl resistant organic matter. The 14C activity of the hydrolysis residue was lower compared to the untreated soil, reaching a 14C age of around 1000 years B.P. in B horizons. This is consistent with the observation that chemical recalcitrant black carbon, produced by slash burning, may remain on site for a long time, once it is incorporated into the mineral soil. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Despite their low carbon (C) content, most subsoil horizons contribute tomore than half of the total soil C stocks, and therefore need to be considered in the global C cycle. Until recently, the properties and dynamics of C in deep soils was largely ignored. The aim of this review is to synthesize literature concerning the sources, composition, mechanisms of stabilisation and destabilization of soil organic matter (SOM) stored in subsoil horizons. OrganicCinput into subsoils occurs in dissolved form (DOC) following preferential flow pathways, as aboveground or root litter and exudates along root channels and/or through bioturbation. The relative importance of these inputs for subsoil C distribution and dynamics still needs to be evaluated. Generally, C in deep soil horizons is characterized by high mean residence times of up to several thousand years. With few exceptions, the carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio is decreasing with soil depth, while the stable C and N isotope ratios of SOM are increasing, indicating that organic matter (OM) in deep soil horizons is highly processed. Several studies suggest that SOMin subsoils is enriched inmicrobial-derived C compounds and depleted in energy-rich plant material compared to topsoil SOM. However, the chemical composition of SOM in subsoils is soil-type specific and greatly influenced by pedological processes. Inter- action with the mineral phase, in particular amorphous iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al) oxides was reported to be the main stabilization mechanism in acid and near neutral soils. In addition, occlusion within soil aggre- gates has been identified to account for a great proportion of SOM preserved in subsoils. Laboratory studies have shown that the decomposition of subsoil C with high residence times could be stimulated by addition of labile C. Other mechanisms leading to destabilisation of SOMin subsoils include disruption of the physical structure and nutrient supply to soil microorganisms. One of the most important factors leading to protection of SOM in subsoils may be the spatial separation of SOM, microorganisms and extracellular enzyme activity possibly related to the heterogeneity of C input. As a result of the different processes, stabilized SOM in subsoils is horizontally stratified. In ordertobetterunderstanddeepSOM dynamics and to include them into soil C models, quantitative information aboutCfluxes resulting fromC input, stabilization and destabilization processes at the field scale are necessary},

  abstract = {Grassland introduction into intensively managed agricultural landscapes may enhance soil organic matter (SOM) content and ecosystem services. However, the magnitude of this effect depends on grassland management practices, and their influence on the soil system. The aim of this paper is to highlight these impacts and their consequences for SOM dynamics and element cycling. We focused in particular on the effect of different grassland management practices in terms of grazing regime, fertilization, and species choice. While carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles are more strongly coupled under grassland as compared to permanent cropping, uncoupling of elemental cycles may occur through management intensification. Grazing regime, fertilization and species choice affect elemental coupling and SOM turnover via organic matter input and rhizosphere activity to different extent, thereby resulting in contrasting SOM storage. Grazing may be more beneficial for SOM contents compared to mowing up to a certain animal density depending on soil type and pedoclimatic context. SOM storage may be increased in some cases through specific fertilizer additions, whereas in others no change was observed. Species choice, e.g. high diversity or introduction of legumes, influence element budgets and soil nutrient availability through plant physiological constraints as well as intra-or interspecific interactions. The effect of different plant species mixtures on soil parameters has rarely been elucidated. We conclude that the impact of grassland management practices on SOM of different soil types and the resulting ecosystem services, such as C and nutrient storage need further research in contrasting pedoclimatic contexts. More studies on the controls of belowground biogeochemical cycling of elements are necessary in order to fully understand and manage belowground processes via aboveground plant communities.},

  abstract = {Up to now stabilization of organic matter (OM) in soils due to mineral interactions has been assessed mainly by correlations between carbon and iron and/or aluminum oxides evidencing that metal oxides may be principal stabilization agents. The nature and morphology of stabilized OM are poorly known. Taking advantage of a field experiment, the aim of our study was to analyze the fate of 13C and 15N labeled root material at 30 and 90 cm depths after three years of incubation and to characterize the nature of OM stabilized by interactions with metal oxides. Our methodological approach included isolation of metal oxides by physical fractionation and visualization of their interaction with OM using NanoSIMS. We concentrated metal oxides in a fraction corresponding to our objectives: the heavy fraction ({$>$}3 g cm−3) of fine silt. NanoSIMS analyses of this fraction allowed us to locate unlabeled OM and OM either double labeled or carrying one single label in association with metal oxides. Our results suggest that decoupling of C and N may have happened during OM stabilization within the timeframe of the 3 year field experiment. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) after NanoSIMS analyzes, indicated that 15N labeled OM at 90 cm were well-defined ovoid OM particles resembling to microbial cells in interaction with Fe, Al and Ti oxides. At 30 cm depth, OM associated with metal oxides was 13C and 15N labeled unstructured material, possibly derived from plant debris. We suggest that at the two soil depths under investigation different processes might be at work, leading to association of OM with mineral compounds of the isolated fraction: in upper soil layers, decomposed plant material may directly interact with metal oxides, whereas in deep mineral soil, OM could mainly interact with metal oxides after microbial turnover. Both types of interactions may be fairly stable as they persisted after ultrasonication and salt extraction.},

However, even the influence of lesser volumes of stones and gravel on estimates of nutrient stocks may be significant. Nutrient analyses are performed on the fine earth fraction. It is therefore necessary to determine the bulk density and the relative soil volume that is occupied by fine earth when expressing nutrient stocks per unit area and to a certain depth. In this study, relative volumes of stones and gravel were investigated in the top soils, i.e. down to 30. cm depth, of five Swedish arable sites. Bulk density and gravel volume were determined by soil coring and stone volume using the rod penetration method. A function for estimation of relative stone volume from mean penetration depth was developed. The function is suitable for soils with low stoniness, i.e. less than 10\%. The results showed that although the relative volumes of stones and gravel were small, at most 8\%, neglecting the volume occupied by rock fragments led to an overestimation of C and N stocks by 8-9\%. The moderate volumes of stones and gravel also significantly affected comparisons between sites. It was concluded that the inclusion of stone and gravel volume of arable soils may be important if nutrient stocks of different sites are compared, or the effects of land use changes are scaled up to regional or global levels. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

This study stems from a project in which we created a video game enabling students to use biotechnology to solve a societal problem. As students engaged in the game, they necessarily interacted with the underlying biological principles. The study focused on the extent to which students learned biology concepts in the context of a game-based curriculum. In particular, we explored learning among high school students, stratified across different academic levels (i.e., general, honors, and advanced). We used a pre/post-test repeated measures multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) design and a multi-level assessment strategy with assessments positioned at variable distances from the curriculum to illuminate the nature of student learning and the potential interactions of academic level and learning associated with the game-based curriculum. A total of 647 students from 31 different biology classes, taught by 10 different teachers, participated in the study. Results indicated statistically and practically significant gains in student performance on both a proximal (curriculum-aligned) test and a distal (standards-aligned) exam of biological content knowledge. Students from classes across all three academic levels demonstrated gains with relatively large effect sizes on the proximal test. Whereas the honors and advanced students demonstrated less substantial gains on the distal exam, the general students demonstrated gains of similar effect size on both the proximal and distal assessments. These results suggest that, despite teacher concerns about the potential effectiveness of gaming to support learning among students in lower academic levels, game-based curricula can support learning of important biological content for students of varying academic levels and may, in fact, be most beneficial for lower level students. The affordances of employing a multi-level assessment model for the investigation of innovative curricula are discussed. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 50: 479-499, 2013},

Therefore, loss-on-ignition (LOI) procedure, a simple and cheap method for SOM estimation, which also avoids chromic acid wastes, deserves more attention. The aims of this research were to study the statistical relationships between SOM determined with the LOI (SOMLOI) and WB (SOMWB) methods to compare the spatial variability of SOM in two major plains, Shahrekord and Koohrang plains, of Chaharmahal-va-Bakhtiari Province, Iran. Fifty surface soil samples (0-25 cm) were randomly collected in each plain to determine SOM using the WB method and the LOI procedure at 300, 360, 400, 500 and 550 °C for 2 h. The samples covered wide ranges of soil texture and calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE). The general linear form of the regression equation was calculated to estimate SOMLOI from SOM obtained by the WB method for both overall samples and individual plains. Forty soil samples were also randomly selected to compare the SOM and CCE before and after ignition at each temperature. Overall accuracy of the continuous maps generated for the LOI and WB methods was considered to determine the accordance of two procedures. Results showed a significant positive linear relationship between SOMLOI and SOMWB. Coefficients of determination (R2) of the equations for individual plains were higher than that of the overall equation. Coefficients of determination and line slopes decreased and root mean square error (RMSE) increased with increasing ignition temperature, which may be due to the mineral structural water loss and destruction of carbonates at higher temperatures. A temperature around 360 °C was identified as optimum as it burnt most organic carbon, destroyed less inorganic carbon, caused less clay structural water loss, and used less electrical energy. Although the trends of SOM in the kriged maps by the two procedures accorded well, low overall accuracy was observed for the maps obtained by the two methods. While not suitable for determination where high accuracy is required, determination of organic carbon through LOI is likely suitable for exploratory soil surveys where rough estimation of organic matter is required. © 2011 Soil Science Society of China.},

  abstract = {Abstract Losses of C from decomposing permafrost may be offset by increased productivity of tundra plants, but nitrogen availability partially limits plant growth in tundra ecosystems. In this soil incubation experiment carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling dynamics were examined from the soil surface down through upper permafrost. We found that losses of CO2 were negatively correlated to net N mineralization because C-rich surface soils mineralized little N, while deep soils had low rates of C respiration but high rates of net N mineralization. Permafrost soils released a large flush of inorganic N when initially thawed. Depth-specific rates of N mineralization from the incubation were combined with thaw depths and soil temperatures from a nearby manipulative warming experiment to simulate the potential magnitude, timing, and depth of inorganic N release during the process of permafrost thaw. Our calculations show that inorganic N released from newly thawed permafrost may be similar in magnitude to the increase in N mineralized by warmed soils in the middle of the profile. The total release of inorganic N from the soil profile during the simulated thaw process was twice the size of the observed increase in the foliar N pool observed at the manipulative experiment. Our findings suggest that increases in N availability are likely to outpace the N demand of tundra plants during the first 5 years of permafrost thaw and may increase C losses from surface soils as well as induce denitrification and leaching of N from these ecosystems.},

Although surface and subsurface horizons differ in pedological, environmental and physicochemical features, which are all likely to affect the mechanisms and biological actors involved, models of carbon dynamics tend to assume that the underlying processes are identical in all horizons, but with lower gross fluxes in the subsurface. The aim of this study was to test this assumption by analysing factors governing organic matter decomposition in topsoil (from depths of 5-10 cm) and subsoil (from depths of 80-100 cm). To this end, we established incubations that lasted 51 days, in which factors that were thought to control organic matter mineralization were altered: oxygen concentration, soil structure and the energetic and nutritional status. At the end of the incubation period, the microbial biomass was measured and the community level physiological profiles established. The mineralization per unit organic carbon proved to be as important in the subsoil as it was in surface samples, in spite of lower carbon contents and different catabolic profiles. Differences in the treatment effects indicated that the controls on C dynamics were different in topsoil and subsoil: disrupting the structure of the subsoil caused a 75\% increase in mineralization while the surface samples remained unaffected. On the other hand, a significant priming affect was found in the topsoil but not in the subsoil samples. Spatial heterogeneity in carbon content, respiration and microbial communities was greater in subsoil than in topsoil at the field scale. These data suggest greater attention should be paid to the subsoil if global C dynamics is to be fully understood.},

In lower parts of the soil profile root material contributes greatly to soil organic matter (SOM). The objective of this study was to elucidate the decomposition dynamics of root-derived C and N in different soil depths during a 3 year field experiment and to examine the importance of different protection mechanisms as well as abiotic factors for the decomposition dynamics. Additionally, we assessed the effect of root litter addition on native SOM. Our conceptual approach included the exposure of litterbags with (13)C and (15)N labeled wheat root material mixed to loamy agricultural soil at three different soil depths (30, 60 and 90 cm). During the incubation period, we monitored soil temperature, humidity and the incorporation of root derived C and N into the soil microbial biomass and physical SOM fractions. Our results showed that abiotic decay conditions were better in subsurface horizons compared to the topsoil. Root litter addition significantly increased the size of microbial biomass in all three soil horizons. In the topsoil, root-derived C decomposition was significantly higher in the first 6 months of incubation compared to subsoil horizons. In 60 and 90 cm depths, a lag phase with development of soil microbial biomass seemed to be prevailing before decomposition was activated. For root-derived N, similar decomposition kinetics could be observed in top- and subsoil horizons. Despite of higher SOM contents, better soil structure and higher microbial activity in the topsoil horizon compared to subsoil horizons, the amounts of root-derived C and N remaining after 3 years were similar for all three depths. Most of the root-derived C and N was present as organo-mineral complexes or occluded in soil aggregates (oPOM), illustrating similar importance of these two protection mechanisms in all three soil depths. Addition of fresh root litter caused small losses of native soil C whereas native N was retained. We conclude that despite of similar SOM protection mechanisms, there are distinct differences in decomposition dynamics of root litter between top- and subsoil horizons. In the long run, the better abiotic decay conditions prevailing in subsoil horizons may compensate for their poorer physico-chemical characteristics.},

  abstract = {For soil carbon to be effectively sequestered beyond a timescale of a few decades, this carbon must become incorporated into passive reservoirs or greater depths, yet the actual mechanisms by which this occurs is at best poorly known. In this study, we quantified the magnitude of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) leaching and subsequent retention in soils of a coniferous forest and a coastal prairie ecosystem. Despite small annual losses of DOC relative to respiratory losses, DOC leaching plays a significant role in transporting C from surface horizons and stabilizing it within the mineral soil. We found that DOC movement into the mineral soil constitutes 22\% of the annual C inputs below 40 cm in a coniferous forest, whereas only 2\% of the C inputs below 20 cm in a prairie soil could be accounted for by this process. In line with these C input estimates, we calculated advective transport velocities of 1.05 and 0.45 mm year−1 for the forested and prairie sites, respectively. Radiocarbon measurements of field-collected DOC interpreted with a basic transport-turnover model indicated that DOC which was transported and subsequently absorbed had a mean residence time of 90–150 years. Given these residence times, the process of DOC movement and retention is responsible for 20\% of the total mineral soil C stock to 1 m in the forest soil and 9\% in the prairie soil. These results provide quantitative data confirming differences in C cycles in forests and grasslands, and suggest the need for incorporating a better mechanistic understanding of soil C transport, storage and turnover processes into both local and regional C cycle models.},

  abstract = {The movement of soil organic carbon (SOC) during erosion and deposition events represents a major perturbation to the terrestrial carbon cycle. Despite the recognized impact soil redistribution can have on the carbon cycle, few major carbon accounting models currently allow for soil mass flux. Here, we modified a commonly used SOC model to include a soil redistribution term and then applied it to scenarios which explore the implications of unrecognized erosion and deposition for SOC accounting. We show that models that assume a static landscape may be calibrated incorrectly as erosion of SOC is hidden within the decay constants. This implicit inclusion of erosion then limits the predictive capacity of these models when applied to sites with different soil redistribution histories. Decay constants were found to be 15-50\% slower when an erosion rate of 15 t soil ha(-1) yr(-1) was explicitly included in the SOC model calibration. Static models cannot account for SOC change resulting from agricultural management practices focused on reducing erosion rates. Without accounting for soil redistribution, a soil sampling scheme which uses a fixed depth to support model development can create large errors in actual and relative changes in SOC stocks. When modest levels of erosion were ignored, the combined uncertainty in carbon sequestration rates was 0.3-1.0 t CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1) . This range is similar to expected sequestration rates for many management options aimed at increasing SOC levels. It is evident from these analyses that explicit recognition of soil redistribution is critical to the success of a carbon monitoring or trading scheme which seeks to credit agricultural activities.},

Controlled soil column irrigation and leaching experiments were conducted on field moist organic soil horizons toquantifymicrobial activity,DOMproduction and chemistry. Both microbial activity (defined as CO2 production per unit substrate C) and DOM production were found to be lowest in the youngest (0.3 ky) and oldest (4.1 My) sites of the chronosequence, where nutrients (N and P respectively) were most limiting. By contrast, DOM production and microbial activity was greatest at the intermediate-aged (20–350 ky) sites where nutrients were least limiting, unrelated to the mass of organic matter found in the organic horizons. While differences in production rates were found, 13C NMR spectroscopic results indicated that there was a convergence of chemistry from the solid to the dissolved phase at all sites. In particular, all DOM samples were found to have a high proportion of aromatic acids.With supporting data from a diverse range of ecosystems, we postulate thatchemicalhomogenizatio nof DOMrelative to source material is a common feature ofmany ecosystems due to two microbially mediated processes: (1) similar extracellular enzymatic oxidation conferring solubility to a subset of degradation products; and (2) the rapid selective consumption of the more labile organic compounds in the soil solution.},

  abstract = {Adsorption of dissolved organic compounds onto mineral surfaces is increasingly recognized as a significant, if not dominant, carbon stabilisation mechanism in many soils. By utilising carbon-13 enriched dissolved organic carbon (DOC) source materials in a repeated leaching-sorption-incubation study, we show here that the biochemical composition of mineral-retained organic matter (OM) is similar across four different classes of clay minerals but the quantity and stability of this OM is both a function of source material and clay mineralogy. Three to eight times as much carbon was retained on a mass basis when the same amount of DOC derived from eucalyptus versus wheat litter was applied, and the retained wheat-derived OM was up to 2.4 times more degradable than that of the eucalyptus source. For both litter types, carbon retention across the clay types was not significantly different; whereas, the stability of the retained OM was different but depended on which litter extract had been applied. The wheat-derived DOC was more stable when retained by allophane and oxides than by illite and smectite. Solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopic results indicated that despite large compositional differences in both source litter and resultant DOC, the composition of the mineral-retained OM was similar across clay classes with lignin-derived aromatic and carboxylic compounds dominating. Differences in the amount of carbon retained were related to differences in the proportions of aromatic, phenolic and carboxylic C in the DOC produced from the two litter sources. Differences in the stability across the clay classes were correlated with the abundance of metals and short-range ordered minerals. These results suggest that whenever reactive mineral surfaces and metals are present in a soil, a similar form of relatively unaltered litter derived OM can be adsorbed but that the longer term stability of sorbed OM, and thus in situ composition, will be a function of the mineralogy (reactivity) of the specific minerals involved in the binding process.},

Estimating the size and spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) loss due to land use and land cover change has been difficult but is a critical step in understanding whether SOC sequestration can be an effective climate mitigation strategy. In this study, a machine learning-based model was fitted using a global compilation of SOC data and the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE) land use data in combination with climatic, landform and lithology covariates. Model results compared favorably with a global compilation of paired plot studies. Projection of this model onto a world without agriculture indicated a global carbon debt due to agriculture of 133 Pg C for the top 2 m of soil, with the rate of loss increasing dramatically in the past 200 years. The HYDE classes “grazing” and “cropland” contributed nearly equally to the loss of SOC. There were higher percent SOC losses on cropland but since more than twice as much land is grazed, slightly higher total losses were found from grazing land. Important spatial patterns of SOC loss were found: Hotspots of SOC loss coincided with some major cropping regions as well as semiarid grazing regions, while other major agricultural zones showed small losses and even net gains in SOC. This analysis has demonstrated that there are identifiable regions which can be targeted for SOC restoration efforts.},

We explored the relative importance of this sorption mechanism with pedological shifts in soil properties by conducting a dissolved organic matter leaching/sorption experiment using intact soil cores from a substrate/age gradient in Hawai'i. In the subsurface horizons, sorption of dissolved organic carbon was often positively correlated short-range ordered (SRO) mineral content, with sorption rates approaching 100\% when SRO minerals dominated. Dissolved organic matter sorption in the presence of SRO minerals was highly selective towards aromatic compounds, consistent with prior nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy conducted on carbon found in SRO rich mineral soil. In subsurface horizons where SRO content was low (youngest and oldest sites in the chronosequence), sorption was also found to be high but much less selective, more reversible and more degradable indicating that different stabilization mechanisms are operative. These experimental results provide further evidence for a direct mechanism by which volcanic soils are able to store disproportionately high amount of soil organic matter via retention of aromatic acids.},

Using a 30-year time series of soil samples from a well-characterized agronomic trial, we found that the incorporation of the bomb spike in atmospheric 14CO2 into thermal fractions of increasing resistance to thermal decomposition could be successfully modeled. With increasing temperature, which is proportional to activation energy, the mean residence time of the thermal fractions increased from 10 to 400 years. Importantly, the first four of five thermal fractions appeared to be a mixture of fast- and increasingly slower-cycling SOM. To further understand the composition of different thermal fractions, stepped pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) experiments were performed at five temperatures ranging from 330 to 735 C. The Py-GC/MS data showed a reproducible shift in the chemistry of pyrolysis products across the temperature gradient trending from polysaccharides and lipids at low temperature to lignin- and microbe-derived compounds at middle temperatures to aromatic and unknown compounds at the highest temperatures. Integrating the 14C and Py-GC/MS data suggests the organic compounds, with the exception of aromatic moieties likely derived from wildfire, with centennial residence times are not more complex but may be protected from pyrolysis, and likely also from biological mineralization, by interactions with mineral surfaces.},

Henry 'NM6'), a native grass mixture (5 sown species), an early successional community, and a restored prairie (18 sown species). Overall the most productive cropping systems were corn{$>$}giant miscanthus{$>$}and switchgrass, which were significantly more productive than native grasses≈restored prairie≈early successional≈and hybrid poplar, although some systems (e.g. hybrid poplar) differed significantly by location. Highest total ANPP was observed in giant miscanthus (35.2±2.0 Mg ha-1yr-1) at KBS during the sixth growing season. Six-year cumulative biomass yield from hybrid poplar at KBS (55.4±1.3 Mg ha-1) was high but significantly lower than corn and giant miscanthus (65.5±1.5, 65.2±5.5 Mg ha-1, respectively). Hypothesized yield advantages of diversity in perennial cropping systems were not observed during this period. Harvested biomass yields were 60, 56, and 44\% of ANPP for corn, perennial grass, and restored prairie, respectively, suggesting that relatively simple changes in agronomic management (e.g. harvest timing and harvest equipment modification) may provide significant gains in bioenergy crop yields. Species composition was an important determinant of GHE in more diverse systems. Results show that well-established, dedicated bioenergy crops are capable of producing as much biomass as corn stover, but with fewer inputs.},

We investigated the influence of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and micronutrients on seedling biomass and nutrient allocation in a factorial nutrient fertilization experiment in lowland tropical forest at the Barro Colorado Nature Monument, Panama. We also measured 8years of herbivory and growth for 1800 seedlings. We sought to determine the identity of limiting elements and possible nutrient interactions. The five study species were Alseis blackiana, Desmopsis panamensis, Heisteria concinna, Sorocea affinis and Tetragastris panamensis. Plants grew in deeply shaded understorey with a mean canopy openness of 4.9\% (±0.7\%; 1SE). Tissue N concentration increased by 11\% with N addition. Tissue P concentration increased by 16\% with P addition. Tissue K increased by 4\% with K addition. K addition reduced root-to-shoot biomass ratio. There was no significant effect of fertilization on specific leaf area or leaf area ratio. The proportion of leaves damaged and the mean level of damage by herbivory increased with P and K addition and showed a significant P×K interaction. Across all species and years, relative growth rate of height increased with K addition and with N and P in combination. Relative growth rate of leaf count trended 8.5\% higher with K addition (P=0.076). We also added micronutrients in a parallel experiment. There was no effect of micronutrient addition on any seedling parameter. Synthesis. K addition affected seedlings by enhancing tissue nutrient concentration, increasing herbivory, reducing root-to-shoot biomass ratio and increasing height growth. Additional effects of N or P on tissue chemistry, herbivory and growth offer support for the multiple limiting resources hypothesis.

The carbon content and δ13C value of soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial biomass (C(mic)) and respired CO2 were measured in a range of grassland soils from tropical and temperate biomes to determine if isotope effect of microbial degradation can induce a shift in isotope composition of SOC and CO2. The soil from a depth of 0-2 cm was analysed. C(mic) was measured using the chloroform fumigation extraction method, while CO2 was measured in a closed system after 3 and 10 days of incubation. Two soils, temperate and tropical, were used for a long-term experiment, in which measurements were performed after 3, 10 and 40 days of incubation. 2. SOC and C(mic) decrease exponentially with increasing mean annual temperature. C(mic) decreases more slowly than SOC, resulting in a higher proportion of C(mic) in the SOC of tropical soils relative to temperate soils. 3. The δ13C value of C(mic) and respired CO2 reflects gross changes in the δ13C value of SOC in the corresponding sample. On average, C(mic) is 13C-enriched by c. 2‰ compared with SOC, while respired CO2 is 13C-depleted by c. 2.2‰ compared with C(mic). Thus, the observed 13C-enrichment in C(mic) is balanced by a corresponding 13C-depletion in respired CO2 resulting in the δ13C value of respired CO2 being approximately similar to the δ13C of SOC. 4. The isotope effect of microbial degradation is of importance in soil. It can be induced by selective utilization of SOC and isotope discrimination during metabolism. Metabolic isotopic discrimination is dependent on the growth stage of the soil microbial population.},

Their upscaling to coarser scales has been hampered due to the cost and labor to measure C fractions. With the advent of visible/near-infrared-diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (VNIR-DRS) to infer on soil C fractions, new opportunities exist to combine sensor-based and geostatistical methods to estimate them across landscapes. Our research objectives were to (i) assess the accuracy of VNIR-DRS for estimating available C (HC) in soil, and (ii) compare interpolated HC estimates derived from laboratory measurements and VNIR-DRS derived estimates. The study site was within the Rio Grande floodplain in Quemado, Texas with mixed acreage of Arundo donax L. and Cynodon dactylon (L.) pers. Soil samples were taken in 10-cm depth increments from 0- to 50-cm depth, at 125 locations across a 34.5ha field. Total C (TC, dry combustion), inorganic C (IC, modified pressure calcimeter), and HC (extraction at 80°C) were measured and organic C (OC) was calculated by difference (TC-IC). Partial least squares regression (PLSR) and boosted regression tree (RT) were used to relate TC, HC, IC, and OC to VNIR-DRS spectra. Ordinary kriging was used to interpolate HC derived from analytical measurements and the values derived from the best spectral estimation model (PLSR). All four C pools were estimated well using VNIR-DRS and PLSR (R2{$>$}0.77, residual prediction deviation {$>$}2), ratio of performance to inter-quartile distance {$>$} 1.62. Overall, the maps estimating HC derived from VNIR-DRS estimates of HC were comparable to those from analytical measurements. In conclusion, VNIR-DRS reliably predicted soil C, as measured by HC. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The magnetic hysteresis measurements of stoichiometric PSD magnetite samples under hydrostatic pressure were carried out using a piston-cylinder high-pressure cell, and the pressure dependence of the hysteresis parameters of PSD magnetite was calculated from the hysteresis curves. It was found that coercivity (Bc) increases with increasing pressure as a quadratic function up to 1 GPa by  90\%, which is different from the pressure dependences of Bc of multidomain and singledomain magnetites. Coercivity of remanence also increases as a quadratic function, and saturation remanence (Mrs) increases with pressure up to 0.5 GPa by  20\% until reaching saturation. In contrast, saturation magnetization is constant up to 1 GPa. The approximate demagnetizing factor calculated from the ratio Bc/Mrs increases with increasing pressure, suggesting that the number of lamellar domains increases with increasing pressure. The number of lamellar domains and domain wall width are theoretically estimated to increase under high pressure due to the changes in magnetostriction, elastic, and magnetocrystalline anisotropy constants, and these changes in magnetic domain structure should relate to the changes in the magnetic properties of PSD magnetite.},

  abstract = {Soil respiration (Rs) is a combination of autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration, but it is often modeled as a single efflux process, influenced by environmental variables similarly across all time scales. Continued progress in understanding sources of variation in soil CO2 efflux will require development of Rs models that incorporate environmental influences at multiple time scales. Coherence analysis, which requires high temporal frequency data on Rs and related environmental variables, permits examination of covariation between Rs and the factors that influence it at varying temporal frequencies, thus isolating the factors important at each time scale. Automated Rs measurements, along with air, soil temperature and moisture were collected at half hour intervals at a temperate forest at Harvard Forest, MA in 2003 and a boreal transition forest at the Howland Forest, ME in 2005. As in other temperate and boreal forests, seasonal variation in Rs was strongly correlated with soil temperature. The organic and mineral layer water contents were significantly related to Rs at synoptic time scales of 2-3 days to weeks, representing the wetting and drying of the soils as weather patterns move across the region. Post-wetting pulses of Rs were correlated with the amount of precipitation and the magnitude of the change from pre-wet-up moisture content to peak moisture content of the organic horizon during the precipitation events. Although soil temperature at 8-10 cm depth and Rs showed strong coherence at a 24-h interval, calculated diel Q10 values for Rs were unreasonably high (6-74) during all months for the evergreen forest and during the growing season for the deciduous forest, suggesting that other factors that covary with soil temperature, such as canopy assimilatory processes, may also influence the diel amplitude of Rs. Lower diel Q10 values were obtained based on soil temperature measured at shallower depths or with air temperature, but the fit was poorer and a lag was needed to improve the fit (peak Rs followed peak air temperature by several hours), suggesting a role for delayed substrate supply from aboveground processes to affect diel patterns of Rs. High frequency automated Rs datasets afford the opportunity to disentangle the temporal scales at which environmental factors, such as seasonal temperature and phenology, synoptic weather events and soil moisture, and diel variation in temperature and photosynthesis, affect soil respiration processes. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

The magnitude of carbon (C) loss to the atmosphere via microbial decomposition is a function of the amount of C stored in soils, the quality of the organic matter, and physical, chemical, and biological factors that comprise the environment for decomposition. The decomposability of C is commonly assessed by laboratory soil incubation studies that measure greenhouse gases mineralized from soils under controlled conditions. Here, we introduce the Soil Incubation Database (SIDb) version 1.0, a compilation of time series data from incubations, structured into a new, publicly available, open-access database of C flux (carbon dioxide, CO2, or methane, CH4). In addition, the SIDb project also provides a platform for the development of tools for reading and analysis of incubation data as well as documentation for future use and development. In addition to introducing SIDb, we provide reporting guidance for database entry and the required variables that incubation studies need at minimum to be included in SIDb. A key application of this synthesis effort is to better characterize soil C processes in Earth system models, which will in turn reduce our uncertainty in predicting the response of soil C decomposition to a changing climate. We demonstrate a framework to fit curves to a number of incubation studies from diverse ecosystems, depths, and organic matter content using a built-in model development module that integrates SIDb with the existing SoilR package to estimate soil C pools from time series data. The database will help bridge the gap between point location measurements, which are commonly used in incubation studies, and global remote-sensed data or data products derived from models aimed at assessing global-scale rates of decomposition and C turnover. The SIDb version 1.0 is archived and publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3871263 (Sierra et al., 2020), and the database is managed under a version-controlled system and centrally stored in GitHub (https://github.com/SoilBGC-Datashare/sidb, last access: 26 June 2020).}

We instrumented a Typic Durorthod with zero-tension lysimeters to capture water leaving the O, E, and B hori- zons and with sensors to determine volumetric water contents with depth. We also occasionally measured snowpack depths and determined snow water equivalents. These field data were used to validate a hydrologic model that was run for the site using nearby National Weather Service (NWS) data. Good agreement between the modeled output and field data from the site enabled us to apply 1961 to 2013 NWS data from three additional stations along a transect that spans the range of podzolization strength in Michigan as inputs to the model. Soils remain dry throughout the summer and slow- ly wet up in fall. The more strongly developed soils in the north are slightly wetter in fall, facilitating breakdown of fresh litter and enhancing produc- tion of soluble organic materials. Their translocation into the mineral soil is presumably deepest and most pronounced during snowmelt, facilitated by a strong “pulse” of cold snowmelt water. This pulse comprises well over half of the annual flux of water at 100-cm depth, even though its timespan is short. Snowmelt fluxes are larger and of shorter duration in the north, where podzolization is strongest. By storing precipitation in a thick snowpack, the pedogenic system compresses inputs of water, creating deeper, more con- centrated pulses of percolation when soluble organic materials are readily available; this is the essence of podzolization in this region.},

  abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is often neglected as a factor in the formation of stable soil organic matter (OM). Precipitation of DOM by dissolved Al could contribute substantially to C retention in acidic forest soils; however, no information is available on the stability of precipitated OM against microbial decay. We investigated the stability of Al–OM precipitates against microbial decay as related to (i) DOM composition, (ii) Al speciation, and (iii) the dissolved Al/C ratio. We produced Al–OM precipitates by adding AlCl3 (molar Al/C ratios: 0.05–0.3) at pH values of 3.8 and 4.5 to DOM solutions derived from Oi and Oa horizons, from either beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) or spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst.] litter. Between 13 and 84\% of the C was precipitated, depending on pH, Al/C ratio, and the type of DOM. Precipitates were found to be enriched in aromatic C and mostly depleted in N when compared with DOM. Only 0.5 to 7.7\% of precipitated C was mineralized during 7 wk of incubation. Mineralization of Al–OM precipitates was up to 28 times less than that of the respective DOM solutions. The extent of mineralization of Al–OM precipitates formed at pH 3.8 was reduced by 50 to 75\% when compared with those formed at pH 4.5. The stability of precipitates against microbial decay increased with larger aromatic C content and larger C/N ratios. Our study clearly demonstrated that a large fraction of DOM can be precipitated and is thereby substantially stabilized against microbial decay.},

  abstract = {Traditional models of soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition are all based on first order kinetics in which the decomposition rate of a particular C pool is proportional to the size of the pool and a simple decomposition constant (dC/dt = kC). In fact, SOM decomposition is catalyzed by extracellular enzymes that are produced by microorganisms. We built a simple theoretical model to explore the behavior of the decomposition-microbial growth system when the fundamental kinetic assumption is changed from first order kinetics to exoenzymes catalyzed decomposition (dC/dt = KC x Enzymes). An analysis of the enzyme kinetics showed that there must be some mechanism to produce a non-linear response of decomposition rates to enzyme concentration - the most likely is competition for enzyme binding on solid substrates as predicted by Langmuir adsorption isotherm theory. This non-linearity also induces C limitation, regardless of the potential supply of C. The linked C and N version of the model showed that actual polymer breakdown and microbial use of the released monomers can be disconnected, and that it requires relatively little N to maintain the maximal rate of decomposition, regardless of the microbial biomass' ability to use the breakdown products. In this model, adding a pulse of C to an N limited system increases respiration, while adding N actually decreases respiration (as C is redirected from waste respiration to microbial growth). For many years, researchers have argued that the lack of a respiratory response by soil microbes to added N indicates that they are not N limited. This model suggests that conclusion may be wrong. While total C flow may be limited by the functioning of the exoenzyme system, actual microbial growth may be N limited. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Physiological responses to stress have costs at the organismal level that can result in altered ecosystem-level C, energy, and nutrient flows. These large-scale impacts result from direct effects on active microbes' physiology and by controlling the composition of the active microbial community. We first consider some general aspects of how microbes experience environmental stresses and how they respond to them. We then discuss the impacts of two important ecosystem-level stressors, drought and freezing, on microbial physiology and community composition. Even when microbial community response to stress is limited, the physiological costs imposed on soil microbes are large enough that they may cause large shifts in the allocation and fate of C and N. For example, for microbes to synthesize the osmolytes they need to survive a single drought episode they may consume up to 5\% of total annual net primary production in grassland ecosystems, while acclimating to freezing conditions switches Arctic tundra soils from immobilizing N during the growing season to mineralizing it during the winter. We suggest that more effectively integrating microbial ecology into ecosystem ecology will require a more complete integration of microbial physiological ecology, population biology, and process ecology.},

  abstract = {A major thrust of terrestrial microbial ecology is focused on understanding when and how the composition of the microbial community affects the functioning of biogeochemical processes at the ecosystem scale (meters-to-kilometers and days-to-years). While research has demonstrated these linkages for physiologically and phylogenetically "narrow" processes such as trace gas emissions and nitrification, there is less conclusive evidence that microbial community composition influences the "broad" processes of decomposition and organic matter (OM) turnover in soil. In this paper, we consider how soil microbial community structure influences C cycling. We consider the phylogenetic level at which microbes form meaningful guilds, based on overall life history strategies, and suggest that these are associated with deep evolutionary divergences, while much of the species-level diversity probably reflects functional redundancy. We then consider under what conditions it is possible for differences among microbes to affect process dynamics, and argue that while microbial community structure may be important in the rate of OM breakdown in the rhizosphere and in detritus, it is likely not important in the mineral soil. In mineral soil, physical access to occluded or sorbed substrates is the rate-limiting process. Microbial community influences on OM turnover in mineral soils are based on how organisms allocate the C they take up - not only do the fates of the molecules differ, but they can affect the soil system differently as well. For example, extracellular enzymes and extracellular polysaccharides can be key controls on soil structure and function. How microbes allocate C may also be particularly important for understanding the long-term fate of C in soil - is it sequestered or not?},

  abstract = {Throughout Earth's history, drought has been a common crisis in terrestrial ecosystems; in human societies, it can cause famine, one of the Four Horsemen of the apocalypse. As the global hydrological cycle intensifies with global warming, deeper droughts and rewetting will alter, and possibly transform, ecosystems. Soil communities, however, seem more tolerant than plants or animals are to water stress—the main effects, in fact, on soil processes appear to be limited diffusion and the limited supply of resources to soil organisms. Thus, the rains that end a drought not only release soil microbes from stress but also create a resource pulse that fuels soil microbial activity. It remains unclear whether the effects of drought on soil processes result from drying or rewetting. It is also unclear whether the flush of activity on rewetting is driven by microbial growth or by the physical/chemical processes that mobilize organic matter. In this review, I discuss how soil water, and the lack of it, regulates microbial life and biogeochemical processes. I first focus on organismal-level responses and then consider how these influence whole-soil organic matter dynamics. A final focus is on how to incorporate these effects into Earth System models that can effectively capture dry–wet cycling.},

Formation of biomolecule-rich supramolecular complexes in dissolved organic matter (DOM) and subsequent adsorption onto minerals is important for the development of mineral-stabilized organic matter, yet the impact of supramolecular association on interfacial behavior is seldom studied. A series of supramolecular complexes of model biomolecules (deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA)) are synthesized, characterized, and adsorbed onto goethite. Complexes represent 0.1 mg/mL DNA mixed with BSA concentrations from 0.05 to 0.5 mg/mL in 5 mM KCl at pH = 5.0. Circular dichroism demonstrates strong binding between DNA and BSA, with DNA saturation when (BSA) ≈ 0.4 mg/mL. Dynamic light scattering and electrophoretic mobility measurements suggest DNA-BSA binding reduces DNA-DNA electrostatic repulsion. Spectroscopic studies of DNA/BSA complex adsorption show complexation hinders coordination of DNA phosphodiester groups with goethite. Increasing BSA (≤0.4 mg/mL) in DNA/BSA complexes enhances DNA adsorption, due to reduced repulsion between adsorbed DNA helices. When (BSA) {$>$} 0.4 mg/mL, however, DNA adsorption is decreased. We hypothesize this results from blocking of surface sites by fast adsorption of BSA loosely associated with DNA/BSA complexes. We posit an additional mechanism describing multilayered architecture formation of organo-mineral associations in soil, suggesting solution interactions may represent an overlooked factor when considering mineral retention of DOM.}

  abstract = {Rising temperatures enhance microbial decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) and thereby increase the soil CO2 efflux. Elevated decomposition rates might differently affect distinct SOM pools, depending on their stability and accessibility. Soil fractions derived from density fractionation have been suggested to represent SOM pools with different turnover times and stability against microbial decomposition. To investigate the effect of soil warming on functionally different soil organic matter pools, we here investigated the chemical and isotopic composition of bulk soil and three density fractions (free particulate organic matter, fPOM; occluded particulate organic matter, oPOM; and mineral associated organic matter, MaOM) of a C-rich soil from a long-term warming experiment in a spruce forest in the Austrian Alps. At the time of sampling, the soil in this experiment had been warmed during the snow-free period for seven consecutive years. During that time no thermal adaptation of the microbial community could be identified and CO2 release from the soil continued to be elevated by the warming treatment. Our results, which included organic carbon content, total nitrogen content, δ13C, Δ14C, δ15N and the chemical composition, identified by pyrolysis-GC/MS, showed no significant differences in bulk soil between warming treatment and control. Surprisingly, the differences in the three density fractions were mostly small and the direction of warming induced change was variable with fraction and soil depth. Warming led to reduced N content in topsoil oPOM and subsoil fPOM and to reduced relative abundance of N-bearing compounds in subsoil MaOM. Further, warming increased the δ13C of MaOM at both sampling depths, reduced the relative abundance of carbohydrates while it increased the relative abundance of lignins in subsoil oPOM. As the size of the functionally different SOM pools did not significantly change, we assume that the few and small modifications in SOM chemistry result from an interplay of enhanced microbial decomposition of SOM and increased root litter input in the warmed plots. Overall, stable functional SOM pool sizes indicate that soil warming had similarly affected easily decomposable and stabilized SOM of this C-rich forest soil.},

It is a particularly challenging case of environmental communication because its main cause, greenhouse gas emissions, is invisible. The predominant approach of making climate change visible is the use of iconic, often affective, imagery. Literature on the iconography of climate change shows that global iconic motifs, such as polar bears, have contributed to a public perception of the problem as spatially and temporally remote. This paper proposes an alternative approach to global climate change icons by focusing on recognizable representations of local impacts within an interactive game environment. This approach was implemented and tested in a research project based on the municipality of Delta, British Columbia. A major outcome of the research is Future Delta, an interactive educational game featuring 3D visualizations and simulation tools for climate change adaptation and mitigation future scenarios. The empirical evaluation is based on quantitative pre/ post-game play questionnaires with 18 students and 10 qualitative expert interviews. The findings support the assumption that interactive 3D imagery is effective in communicating climate change. The quantitative post-questionnaires particularly highlight a shift in support of more local responsibility.},

  abstract = {Precise determination of changes in organic car- bon (OC) stocks is prerequisite to understand the role of soils in the global cycling of carbon and to verify changes in stocks due to management. A large dataset was collected to form base to repeated soil inventories at 12 CarboEurope sites under different climate and land-use, and with differ- ent soil types. Concentration of OC, bulk density (BD), and fine earth fraction were determined to 60cm depth at 100 sampling points per site. We investigated (1) time needed to detect changes in soil OC, assuming future re-sampling of 100 cores; (2) the contribution of different sources of uncer- tainties to OC stocks; (3) the effect of OC stock calculation on mass rather than volume base for change detection; and (4) the potential use of pedotransfer functions (PTF) for esti- mating BD in repeated inventories. The period of time needed for soil OC stocks to change strongly enough to be detectable depends on the spatial vari- ability of soil properties, the depth increment considered, and the rate of change. Cropland sites, having small spatial vari- ability, had lower minimum detectable differences (MDD) with 100 sampling points (105±28gCm−2 for the upper 10cm of the soil) than grassland and forest sites (206±64 and 246±64gCm−2 for 0–10cm, respectively). Expected general trends in soil OC indicate that changes could be de- tectable after 2–15 yr with 100 samples if changes occurred in the upper 10cm of stone-poor soils. Error propagation analyses showed that in undisturbed soils with lowstone con- tents, OC concentrations contributed most to OC stock vari- ability while BD and fine earth fraction were more impor- tant in upper soil layers of croplands and in stone rich soils. Though the calculation of OC stocks based on equivalent soil masses slightly decreases the chance to detect changes with time at most sites except for the croplands, it is still recommended to account for changing bulk densities with time. Application of PTF for the estimation of bulk densities caused considerable underestimation of total variances ofOC stocks if the error associated with the PTF was not accounted for, which rarely is done in soil inventories. Direct measure- ment of all relevant parameters approximately every 10 yr is recommended for repeated soil OC inventories.},

  abstract = {Conceptual models suggest that stability of organic carbon (OC) in soil depends on the source of plant litter, occlusion within aggregates, incorporation in organomineral complexes, and location within the soil profile. Density fractionation is a useful tool to study the relevance of OC stabilization in aggregates and in association with minerals, but it has rarely been applied to full soil profiles. We aim to determine factors shaping the depth profiles of physically unprotected and mineral associated OC and test their relevance for OC stability across a range of European soils that vary in vegetation, soil types, parent material, and land use. At each of the 12 study sites, 10 soil cores were sampled to 60 cm depth and subjected to density separation. Bulk soil samples and density fractions (free light fractions - fLF, occluded light fractions - oLF, heavy fractions - HF) were analysed for OC, total nitrogen (TN), delta C-13, and Delta C-14. Bulk samples were also incubated to determine CO2 evolution per g OC in the samples (specific mineralization rates) as an indicator for OC stability. Depth profiles of OC in the light fraction (LF-OC) matched those of roots for undisturbed grassland and forest sites, suggesting that roots are shaping the depth distribution of LF-OC. Organic C in the HF declined less with soil depth than LF-OC and roots, especially at grassland sites. The decrease in Delta C-14 (increase in age) of HF-OC with soil depth was related to soil pH as well as to dissolved OC fluxes. This indicates that dissolved OC translocation contributes to the formation of subsoil HF-OC and shapes the Delta C-14 profiles. The LF at three sites were rather depleted in C-14, indicating the presence of fossil material such as coal and lignite, probably inherited from the parent material. At the other sites, modern Delta C-14 signatures and positive correlations between specific mineralization rates and fLF-OC indicate the fLF is a potentially available energy and nutrient source for subsurface microorganisms throughout the profile. Declining specific mineralization rates with soil depth confirm greater stability of OC in subsoils across sites. The overall importance of OC stabilization by binding to minerals was demonstrated by declining specific mineralization rates with increasing contributions of HF-OC to bulk soil OC, and the low Delta C-14 values of HF-OC. The stability of HF-OC was greater in subsoils than in topsoils; nevertheless, a portion of HF-OC was active throughout the profile. While quantitatively less important than OC in the HF, consistent older ages of oLF-OC than fLF-OC suggest that occlusion of LF-OC in aggregates also contributes to OC stability in subsoils. Overall, our results indicate that association of OC in soils, irrespective of vegetation, soil type, and land use.},

  abstract = {Radiocarbon measurements are frequently used to model the turnover of soil organic carbon (OC) fractions. The assumption of homogeneous turnover in these fractions is typically stated, but consequences of its violation have not been tested. We used samples of a repeated soil inventory of a German beech forest from the litter layer to 50cm depth in 2004 and 2009 to determine the suitability of short-term repeated radiocarbon inventories for estimating the turnover times of OC in soil fractions. Samples from 0-5 and 10-20cm soil depth were density separated into a free light fraction (fLF), an occluded light fraction (oLF), and a heavy, mineral-associated fraction (HF). Samples were analysed for radiocarbon (δ14C), OC, and total nitrogen (TN) contents.Similar portions of OC were stored in the HF, but contributions of fLF and oLF varied between study years, probably due to interannual variations or methodological constraints. Following declining atmospheric CO2-14C, also δ14C values at 0-5cm depth declined significantly between 2004 and 2009. Exchange of old for new OC was largest in the fLF and smallest in the HF, which confirms slow turnover of OC associated with minerals. Model results revealed that turnover time estimates based on single-pool models were not in agreement with observed changes in any of the fractions, suggesting all of them to be mixtures, to varying degrees, of fast and slow cycling pools. While single-pool models suggest average turnover times of 115years for HF-OC at 0-5cm depth, thus being a stable fraction, fitting a two-pool model to the two-point measurements of radiocarbon suggested the presence of a fast cycling pool of 15-25years of turnover time. It was however only possible to constrain the portion of this fast pool as being between 50 and 85\% of total HF-OC. Increasing δ14C in bulk soil and density fractions between study years at 10-20cm depth suggest that OC enters deeper soil layers with a longer time lag than topsoil layers, e.g., by slow transport, and 5years was not enough to induce significant changes.Even 40. years after the bomb peak, radiocarbon time series are still suitable to detect OC fractions of decadal turnover and hint at time lags and translocation processes. Nevertheless, they do not allow for fixing the portions of fast and slow cycling OC in two-pool models and their turnover times.},

  abstract = {The diverse nature of soils introduces uncertainty into the estimation of soil organic carbon (SOC) storage. Laboratory analyses indicate C concentration in soils, but the soil layer thickness, bulk density, and percent of fragments {$>$} 2 mm. must be known in order to estimate SOC storage. Ideally, measurements of SOC concentration are performed on the same soil samples used to determine bulk density and percent of fragments {$>$} 2 mm, but this is frequently not possible. Often measurements of SOC concentration, bulk density, and percent of fragments {$>$} 2 mm are obtained separately from the same soil layer, which causes propagation of error when estimating SOC storage. Furthermore, measurements of bulk density and percent of fragments {$>$} 2 nun are more difficult to obtain than measurements of SOC concentration. Because of this, samples of bulk density and percent of fragments {$>$} 2 mm. are often taken independently and less frequently than samples for SOC concentration. The objective of this study was to derive an estimation method for the variability in SOC storage estimates as a function of SOC concentration, bulk density, percent of fragments {$>$} 2 mm, and soil thickness. The method of statistical differentials, also known as the delta method, was used to obtain an estimate of the variability in SOC storage estimates. The variance estimation procedure is illustrated using previously published data for the Russian Chernozem under different management regimes. The method of statistical differentials is a valuable tool for obtaining variance estimates in a large class of problems with similar characteristics.},

While sorptive processes are known to limit DOM losses, there are still uncertainties about what regulates DOM composition. This study examined DOM dynamics in waters percolating through ex-situ soil cores from six diverse forest soils to determine if DOM leaching losses reflected dynamic exchange processes between fresh DOM inputs and soil surfaces or the continual stripping of surface-reactive compounds from recent DOM inputs. There was a net desorption of hydrophilic compounds into soil solutions after 10cm soil depth that coincided with an increase in DOM biodegradability as solutions percolated to depth. There was also a limited net retention of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in surface soils. Taken together, these results support a dynamic exchange model of DOM dynamics where highly sorptive, hydrophobic compounds displace previously sorbed, N-rich hydrophilic compounds from soil surfaces. These soils also demonstrated fairly consistent leaching losses of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and DON despite their variation in texture, hydraulic conductivity, and Fe and Al mineralogy, removing 72-85\% of the DOC added by 50cm depth. The strong sorption capacity of these soils may be one reason for the fairly uniform DOM chemistry leaching from these soil cores. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Scaling is widely recognized as a central issue in ecology. The associated cross-scale interactions and process transmutations make scaling (i.e. a change in spatial or temporal grain and extent) an important issue in understanding ecosystem structure and functioning. Moreover, current concepts of ecosystem stewardship, such as sustainability and resilience, are inherently scale-dependent. The importance of scale and scaling in the context of forest management is likely to further increase in the future because of the growing relevance of ecosystem services beyond timber production. As a result, a consideration of processes both below (e.g. leaf-level carbon uptake in the context of climate change mitigation) and above (e.g. managing for biodiversity conservation at the landscape scale) the traditional focus on the stand level is required in forest ecosystem management. Furthermore, climate change will affect a variety of ecosystem processes across scales, ranging from photosynthesis (tree organs) to disturbance regimes (landscape scale). Assessing potential climate change impacts on ecosystem services thus requires a multi-scale perspective. However, scaling issues have received comparatively little attention in the forest management community to date. Our objectives here are thus first, to synthesize scaling issues relevant to forest management and second, to elucidate ways of dealing with complex scaling problems by highlighting examples of how they can be addressed with ecosystem models. We have focused on three current management issues of particular importance in European forestry: (1) climate change mitigation through carbon sequestration, (2) multi-functional stand management for biodiversity and non-timber goods and services and (3) improving the resilience to natural disturbances. We conclude that taking into account the full spatiotemporal heterogeneity and dynamics of forest ecosystems in management decision-making is likely to make management more robust to increasing environmental and societal pressures. Models can aid this process through explicitly accounting for system dynamics and changing conditions, operationally addressing the complexity of cross-scale interactions and emerging properties. Our synthesis indicates that increased attention to scaling issues can help forest managers to integrate traditional management objectives with emerging concerns for ecosystem services and therefore deserves more attention in forestry.},

The study was carried out in a small area of the Schwingbach catchment, an anthropogenic-influenced landscape in central Germany. We investigated 30 different soil water samples from 4 sites and different depths (managed meadow (0–5cm, 40–50cm), deciduous forest (0–5cm), mixed-coniferous forest (0–5cm) and agricultural land (0–5cm, 40–50cm)) and 8 stream samples. 6194 molecular formulae and their magnitude-weighted parameters ((O/C)w, (H/C)w, (N/C)w, (AI-mod)w, (DBE/C)w, (DBE/O)w, (DBE-O)w, (C\#)w, (MW)w) were used to describe the molecular composition of the samples. The samples can be roughly divided in three groups. Group 1 contains samples from managed meadow 40–50cm and stream water, which are characterized by high saturation compared to samples from group 2 including agricultural samples and samples from the surface meadow (0–5cm), which held more nitrogen containing and aromatic compounds. Samples from both forested sites (group 3) are characterized by higher molecular weight and O/C ratio. Environmental parameters vary between sites and among these parameters pH and nitrate significantly affect chemical composition of DOM. Results indicate that most DOM in streams is of terrestrial origin. However, 120 molecular formulae were detected only in streams and not in any of the soil samples. These compounds share molecular formulae with peptides, unsaturated aliphatics and saturated FA-CHO/FA-CHOX. Compounds only found in soil samples are much more aromatic, have more double bonds and a much lower H/C ratio but higher oxygen content, which indicates the availability of fresh plant material and less microbial processed material compared to stream samples.},

  abstract = {Denitrification is a critical process regulating the removal of bioavailable nitrogen (N) from natural and human-altered systems. While it has been extensively studied in terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems, there has been limited communication among denitrification scientists working in these individual systems. Here, we compare rates of denitrification and controlling factors across a range of ecosystem types. We suggest that terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems in which denitrification occurs can be organized along a continuum ranging from (1) those in which nitrification and denitrification are tightly coupled in space and time to (2) those in which nitrate production and denitrification are relatively decoupled. In aquatic ecosystems, N inputs influence denitrification rates whereas hydrology and geomorphology influence the proportion of N inputs that are denitrified. Relationships between denitrification and water residence time and N load are remarkably similar across lakes, river reaches, estuaries, and continental shelves. Spatially distributed global models of denitrification suggest that continental shelf sediments account for the largest portion (44\%) of total global denitrification, followed by terrestrial soils (22\%) and oceanic oxygen minimum zones (OMZs; 14\%). Freshwater systems (groundwater, lakes, rivers) account for about 20\% and estuaries 1\% of total global denitrification. Denitrification of land-based N sources is distributed somewhat differently. Within watersheds, the amount of land-based N denitrified is generally highest in terrestrial soils, with progressively smaller amounts denitrified in groundwater, rivers, lakes and reservoirs, and estuaries. A number of regional exceptions to this general trend of decreasing denitrification in a downstream direction exist, including significant denitrification in continental shelves of N from terrestrial sources. Though terrestrial soils and groundwater are responsible for much denitrification at the watershed scale, per-area denitrification rates in soils and groundwater (kg N x km(-2) x yr(-1)) are, on average, approximately one-tenth the per-area rates of denitrification in lakes, rivers, estuaries, continental shelves, or OMZs. A number of potential approaches to increase denitrification on the landscape, and thus decrease N export to sensitive coastal systems exist. However, these have not generally been widely tested for their effectiveness at scales required to significantly reduce N export at the whole watershed scale.},

T e study was conducted at the Kellogg Biological Station Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in southwest Michigan. T e studied treatments were chisel-plow (CT) and no-till (NT) with conventional chemical inputs and a chisel-plow organic management system with winter leguminous cover crops (CT-cover). At the 0- to 5-cm depth in both upperslope and valley positions total C and N contents of NT management were the highest followed by CT-cover and then CT. At 0- to 15-, 20- to 30-, and 30- to 40-cm depths, treatment eff ects varied depending on the landscape position. T ere were no diff erences among the treatments in upperslopes, while in the valleys total C and N tended to be the highest in NT and CT-cover followed by CT. T e results indicated the importance of accounting for interaction between topography and management practices when assessing C sequestration across landscapes with varying topography.

Overall, CT-cover was found to be as effi cient in maintaining C and N content as no-till with conventional chemical inputs. Power analysis for C and N stocks at the 0- to 40-cm depth revealed that because of high variability in total C and N stocks at greater depths, the 10 to 30 samples per treatment available in this study were inadequate to detect diff erences in C and N stocks if thh diff erences were {$<$} 26 Mg C ha–1.},

  abstract = {Climate and land-use changes modify plant rooting depth, signifying that organic matter with long residence times in deep soil layers can be exposed to rhizospheres and associated microbial activities. The presence of roots in soils stimulates mineralization of native soil C, via a process termed the rhizosphere priming effect (RPE), which may in consequence lead to loss of soil C. By growing a deep rooting grass, Festuca arundinacea, on soil columns and under continuous dual labelling (13C- \& 14C-CO2), we show that root penetration up to 80 cm into a soil profile stimulated mineralization of ∼15,000 year-old soil C. The RPE, after normalization with root biomass, was similar along the soil profile indicating that deep C is as vulnerable to priming as surface C. The RPE was strongly correlated with respiration of plant-derived C, and a PLFA marker representative of saprophytic fungi (18:2ɷ6c) across all soil layers. Moreover, experimental disruption of soil structure further stimulated soil C mineralization. These findings suggest that the slow soil C mineralization in deep layers results from an impoverishment of energy-rich plant C for microorganisms (especially for saprophytic fungi), combined with a physical disconnection between soil C and microorganisms. Based on our results, we anticipate higher mineralization rates of deep millennia-old SOM in response to deeper root penetration which could be induced by changes in agricultural practices and climate.},

We investigated organic carbon (C) fractions, content of short-range order constituents (SRO) (i.e., Al and Fe oxy-hydroxides) and OM chemistry of 45 top soils across a range of soil orders and land uses in New Zealand. The objective of the study was to assess the influence of different land uses on the OM quality and quantity of soils that differed in their content of SRO constituents. The C fractions considered were cold + hot water-soluble C (CH2O), C recovered in the residuum after HF treatment (CHF-residuum), and C not so recovered (CHF-mobile). Carbon in particulate OM (CPOM) was determined in non-Allophanic soils, and C extractable with sodium pyrophosphate (Cp) in Allophanic soils. The chemistry of the HF-residual OM was investigated using pyrolysis-GC/MS. The highest C content was found under grazed grasslands and, among soil orders, in Allophanic soils, which had the largest CHF-mobile and CHF-residuum contents. Yet compared to non-Allophanic, Allophanic soils were more vulnerable to loss of C (CHF-mobile and CHF-residuum) when used for cropping. The relative contribution of microbial- vs. plant-derived OM was influenced by soil order and land use: microbial-derived OM increased as the presence of SRO constituents increased, these being more abundant in Allophanic soils; soils under ungrazed grasslands had the largest contribution of fresh plant-derived molecules to OM (and of CHF-residuum to total C) while cropping had a negative impact on the contribution of plant-derived OM, consistent with a decrease in CPOM. Overall, the results showed that not only is the ability of New Zealand soils to store C soil-specific, but so too is their vulnerability to losing it when under specific land use.},

This study compared sampling and data analysis optimization approaches for estimating SOC stocks of a complex agroecosystem. Soil samples were collected from a 232-ha area of a working dairy farm with multiple land uses, crop rotations, topographic features, and manure application rates. The SOC stocks were estimated by (i) simple mean, (ii) ordinary kriging, (iii) regression kriging, and (iv) using the USDA Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database. Relationships among sampling schemes, estimation approaches, auxiliary information, and SOC stocks were explored. Slope, elevation, soil type, and land use types displayed a high degree of variation at the study site, yet relationships with SOC stocks were weak or nonsignificant. Systematic sampling provided the best coverage of both geographic and attribute space, allowing reliable variogram estimates and RMSEs that increased little with reduced sample number. Random and stratified random sampling approaches resulted in reduced accuracy. Ordinary kriging had lower RMSEs than either regression kriging or the simple mean, and total SOC stocks estimates fluctuated less when sample sizes were reduced. Using SSURGO overestimated total SOC stocks by up to 5.1\% compared with the other approaches, suggesting that this approach may be worthy of evaluation for circumstances with a low budget and low confidence level requirements. Systematic sampling and ordinary kriging can provide an optimal strategy for estimating SOC stocks in agroecosystems with complex topography and land uses.},

Our objective was to develop a efficient and precise IC method by modification of the pressure-calcimeter method. We modified the method by using Wheaton serum bottles (20-mL and 100-mL) sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum tear-off seals as the reaction vessel and a pressure transducer monitored by a digital voltmeter. Our gravimetric IC determination of six soils showed a strong correlation when regressed against IC from the modified pressure-calcimeter method (slope of 0.99, r(2) = 0.998). The method detection limit (MOL) was 0.17 g IC kg(-1) for the 20-mL serum bottles and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.30 g IC kg(-1). The 100-mL serum bottle had a MDL of 0.42 with a LOQ of 2.4 g IC kg(-1). When using a 100-mL, Wheaton serum bottle as the reaction vessel with a 0.50-g sample size, soils containing up to 120 g IC kg(-1), which represent a 100\% CaCO3 equivalent, can be analyzed within the V output range of the pressure transducer. Soil organic C determined by subtraction of IC from total C from combustion analysis correlated well with SOC determined by the Walkley-Black.},

  abstract = {Afforestation is known as an available mitigation activity to climate change because it causes sequestration of CO2 from the atmosphere and stores it as the living biomass and the dead organic matter. However, the response of soil organic carbon (SOC) to afforestation in deep soil layers is still poorly understood. We surveyed previously published literature for changes in deep SOC (defined as at least 10cm deeper than the 0-10cm layer) after afforestation of croplands and grasslands (total 63 sites from 56 literature), in order to examine changes in deep SOC and quantify the relationship between SOC change rates in topsoil and subsoil. The results of the meta analysis indicated that the responses of SOC to afforestation were opposite for cropland than grassland. The SOC in soil depth layers of 0-10, 10-20, 20-40, 40-60 and 60-80cm were reduced with afforestation of grassland but not significantly (p{$>$}0.05), while conversion of cropland to forests (trees or shrubs) increased SOC significantly for each soil depth layer up to 60cm depth (p{$<$}0.05). Significant relationships of SOC change rate were found between topsoil (0-20cm) and deeper soil layers (20-40 and 40-60cm). The linear regression showed that SOC change rate in 0-40cm, 0-60cm, and 0-100cm soil profiles was 1.33, 1.49, and 1.55 times greater, respectively than the change rates in the corresponding 0-20cm depth profile. Partial correlation analysis revealed that stand age and initial SOC content were determinants of deep soil SOC change after afforestation of agricultural soils. This study also showed that the O horizon can play an important role in carbon sequestration after afforestation of agricultural sites. We concluded that subsoil carbon must be taken into account when evaluating of SOC change with afforestation and, therefore, recommended that the soil sampling depth for afforested soils be set to at least 60cm in mineral soils and include the O horizon. However, due to poor study designs and lack of standardized sampling protocols in the literature, these results were high in uncertainty. © 2013.},

An increased flow of carbon from the atmosphere into soil pools could help mitigate anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and climate change. Yet we do not know how quickly soils might respond because the age distribution of soil carbon is uncertain. Here we used 789 radiocarbon (∆14C) profiles, along with other geospatial information, to create globally gridded datasets of mineral soil ∆14C and mean age. We found that soil depth is a primary driver of ∆14C, whereas climate (for example, mean annual temperature) is a major control on the spatial pattern of ∆14C in surface soil. Integrated to a depth of 1 m, global soil carbon has a mean age of 4,830 ± 1,730 yr, with older carbon in deeper layers and permafrost regions. In contrast, vertically resolved land models simulate ∆14C values that imply younger carbon ages and a more rapid carbon turnover. Our data-derived estimates of older mean soil carbon age suggest that soils will accumulate less carbon than predicted by current Earth system models over the twenty-first century. Reconciling these models with the global distribution of soil radiocarbon will require a better representation of the mechanisms that control carbon persistence in soils.},

Previous studies have primarily focused on single large cities, with few explorations of the spatiotemporal differences in driving forces of ULSE of different towns in the same administrative region. This study aims to fill this gap. Three port towns of Taicang, located in China's Yangtze River Delta region, were taken as examples to analyze the expansion process of urban land during 1989-2008. Eight factors, including ecological suitability, prime croplands, etc., were selected from four aspects of natural eco-environment, land control policies, accessibility and neighborhood. Binary logistic regression was employed to investigate the effects of various factors on ULSE during various periods in different regions. Results reveal that over the past two decades, urban land expanded rapidly in the three towns, but with different expansion speeds and growth rates. Diversified ULSE factor combinations exist during different periods in different regions, and the factors' relative importance also varies with time and space. The four types of driving factors simultaneously affect ULSE, among which the accessibility is dominant. Based on the findings, we suggest that differentiated policies should be formulated to guide reasonable expansion of urban land. This study can help us better understand the driving mechanism of urban land expansion in small cities and towns, thus has important implications for urban planning and management in China and similar countries. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

An important tool to construct and test models is the incorporation of bomb radiocarbon in soil organic matter during the past decades. In this manuscript, we combined radiocarbon data and a previously developed empirical model to explore decade-scale soil carbon dynamics in a temperate forest ecosystem at the Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, USA. We evaluated the contribution of different soil C fractions to both total soil CO2 efflux and microbially respired C. We tested the performance of the model based on measurable soil organic matter fractions against a decade of radiocarbon measurements. The model was then challenged with radiocarbon measurements from a warming and N addition experiment to test multiple hypotheses about the different response of soil C fractions to the experimental manipulations. Our results showed that the empirical model satisfactorily predicts the trends of radiocarbon in litter, density fractions, and respired CO2 observed over a decade in the soils not subjected to manipulation. However, the model, modified with prescribed relationships for temperature and decomposition rates, predicted most but not all the observations from the field experiment where soil temperatures and nitrogen levels were increased, suggesting that a larger degree of complexity and mechanistic relations need to be added to the model to predict short-term responses and transient dynamics.},

Because soils store large amounts of low-quality carbon, understanding its response to increasing temperatures will help to predict the response of atmospheric CO 2 to climate change. However, empirical studies do not provide conclusive evidence to corroborate this theoretical argument. Although there are various possible reasons for this disagreement, the theory behind this argument has not been scrutinized carefully. Based on a simple mathematical analysis of the Arrhenius equation it is shown here that low-quality substrates are less temperature sensitive when analyzed in absolute rather than in relative terms, a result that may seem counterintuitive to previous theory. However, this is a paradox intrinsic to the Arrhenius equation and it is often ignored within the ‘quality-temperature' debate. In fact, different measures commonly used to analyze the temperature sensitivity of different substrates can provide apparently different and contradictory results even though they are based on the same basic principles. Distinguishing between absolute and relative measures of sensitivity is essential for understanding the sensitivity of respiration to environmental change. An analysis of the available empirical evidence on this topic shows that most studies actually agree with the Arrhenius and thermodynamics theory, with less disagreement than previously thought. To address some of the issues identified here, a formal theoretical framework is proposed to study the sensitivity of respiration rates with respect to changes in multiple drivers of decomposition.},

  abstract = {Soil organic matter models with complex ecological mechanisms usually include a large number of parameters than simpler models that omit detailed processes. Finding parameter values for these complex models is challenging given the poor availability of comprehensive datasets that describe different processes. Depending on the type of data available, the estimation of parameters in complex models may lead to identifiability problems, i.e. obtaining different combinations of parameters that give equally good predictions in comparison with the observed data. In this manuscript, we explore the problem of identifiability in soil organic matter models, pointing out combinations of empirical data and model structure that can minimize identifiability issues. We found that only sets of up to 3 or 4 parameters may be uniquely identifiable, depending on the number of data constrains used for parameter identification. When only using data on soil respiration fluxes from soil incubations or mass loss from litter decay studies, up to 2 parameters can be uniquely identifiable independently on the model structure. For nonlinear microbial models, all parameters cannot be identified simultaneously with mass loss or respiration data, combined with additional constraints from isotopes. Parameter identifiability possess series challenges for proposing complex model structures in global soil carbon models given the limitation of comprehensive datasets at a global scale.},

  abstract = {We propose here a general mathematical framework to represent soil organic matter dynamics. This framework is expressed in the language of dynamical systems and generalizes previous modeling approaches. It is based on a set of six basic principles about the decomposition of soil organic matter: (1) mass balance, (2) substrate dependence of decomposition, (3) heterogeneity of the speed of decay, (4) internal transformations of organic matter, (5) environmental variability effects, and (6) substrate interactions. We show how the majority of models previously proposed are special cases of this general model. This approach provides tools to classify models according to the main principles or concepts they include. It also helps to identify a priori the general behavior of different models or groups of models. Another important characteristic of the proposed mathematical representation is the possibility to develop particular models at any level of detail. This characteristic is described as a modeling hierarchy, in which a general model of a high degree of abstraction can accommodate specific realizations of model structure for specific modeling objectives. This framework also allows us to study general properties of groups of models such as their qualitative behavior, timescale of application, and their dynamic stability. For instance, we find conditions under which models are asymptotically stable, i.e., converge to a stable steady state in the long term, but may approach this state with or without oscillations. We also expand the concept of dynamic stability for models that include time dependencies and do not converge to a fixed steady state, but rather to a region of stability in the state-space. As an example of the application of the concept of dynamic stability, we show how this framework helps to explain the acclimation of soil respiration fluxes in soil-warming experiments.},

Using a set of 30 different exponential smoothing state-space models, the time series were decomposed into their error, trend, and seasonal components, choosing the model that best represented the observed data. According to the best model, the rate of change in Δ14C has decreased considerably since the 1970s and reached values below -5‰ per year since 2005. Overall, the time-series showed larger rates of radiocarbon decline in the northern than in the southern hemisphere, and relatively stable seasonal cycles for both hemispheres. A forecast of the exponential smoothing models predicts that radiocarbon values will reach pre-1950 levels by 2021 in the northern hemisphere with 20\% probability, and by around 2035 in the southern hemisphere. However, at regional levels radiocarbon concentrations have already reached pre-1950 levels in several industrialized regions and cities around the world as a consequence of fossil-fuel emissions.},

Persistence is commonly characterized as turnover or mean residence time of soil organic matter (SOM). However, turnover and residence times are ambiguous measures of persistence, because they could either represent the concepts of age or transit time. To disambiguate these concepts and propose a metric to assess SOM persistence, we calculated age and transit time distributions for a wide range of soil organic carbon (SOC) models. Furthermore, we show how age and transit time distributions can be obtained from a stochastic approach that takes a deterministic model of mass transfers among different pools and creates an equivalent stochastic model at the level of atoms. Using this approach we show: 1) age distributions have relatively old mean values and long tails in relation to transit time distributions, suggesting that carbon stored in soils is on average much older than carbon in the release flux. 2) The difference between mean ages and mean transit times is large, with estimates of SOC persistence in the order of centuries or millennia when assessed using ages, and in the order of decades when using transit or turnover times. 3) The age distribution is an appropriate metric to characterize persistence of SOM. An important implication of our analysis is that random chance is a factor that helps to explain why some organic matter persists for millennia in soil.},

Although climate impacts of carbon emissions by sources can be quantified by global warming potentials, the appropriate formal metrics to assess climate benefits of carbon removals by sinks are unclear. We introduce here the climate benefit of sequestration (CBS), a metric that quantifies the radiative effect of fixing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and retaining it for a period of time in an ecosystem before releasing it back as the result of respiratory processes and disturbances. In order to quantify CBS, we present a formal definition of carbon sequestration (CS) as the integral of an amount of carbon removed from the atmosphere stored over the time horizon it remains within an ecosystem. Both metrics incorporate the separate effects of (i) inputs (amount of atmospheric carbon removal) and (ii) transit time (time of carbon retention) on carbon sinks, which can vary largely for different ecosystems or forms of management. These metrics can be useful for comparing the climate impacts of carbon removals by different sinks over specific time horizons, to assess the climate impacts of ecosystem management, and to obtain direct quantifications of climate impacts as the net effect of carbon emissions by sources versus removals by sinks.},

  abstract = {1 The Park Grass Experiment, begun in 1856, is the oldest ecological experiment in existence. Its value to science has changed and grown since it was founded to answer agricultural questions. In recent times the experiment has shown inter alia how: plant species richness, biomass and pH are related; community composition responds to climatic perturbation and nutrient additions; soil is acidified and corrected by liming. It also provided one of the first demonstrations of the evolution of adaptation at a very local scale and contains a putative case of the evolution of reproductive isolation by reinforcement. The application of molecular genetic markers to archived plant material promises to reveal a whole new chapter of genetic detail about the long-term dynamics of plant populations. 2 Over the range of values observed at Park Grass, biomass (productivity) has a negative effect upon species richness. Any positive effect of species richness on productivity could only be weak by comparison. The experiment provides support for both the competitive exclusion and pool size hypotheses for determination of species density. 3 Instantaneous comparisons of species richness between plots do not accurately reflect temporal rates of loss which may be multiplicative rather than additive. This suggests that comparisons among sites, nutrient inputs, especially N treatments, or soil acidity may in general underestimate the threat posed to plant species diversity by long-term changes in plant nutrient availability, both enrichment and depletion. 4 Differences between plots at the community level are maintained despite a flow of propagules between plots. There is no strong evidence for a spatial mass effect. 5 Guild (grass/legume/other) compositions of plant communities have equilibrated, but the species composition within guilds is more dynamic and continues to change over time, suggesting that species and guild abundances are independently regulated. 6 At least some members of all the major trophic levels, including predators (spiders), herbivores (leafhoppers) and detritivores (springtails) are treatment-specific in their distributions. 7 Plant populations on Park Grass are subdivided by treatments which, to some degree, have led to plots becoming genetically isolated from one another and decoupled demographically. This subdivision has created a metapopulation structure in each species, characterized by species-specific rates of local colonization and extinction. 8 Inverse clines in flowering time occur in the grass Anthoxanthum odoratum across some plot boundaries. These suggest that reproductive isolation between plots has been reinforced by natural selection. 9 Drift as well as selection may have taken place in A. odoratum, especially on plots where effective population size is restricted by population bottlenecks caused by drought. 10 Park Grass illustrates how long-term experiments grow in value with time and how they may be used to investigate scientific questions that were inconceivable at their inception. This is as likely to be true of the future of Park Grass as it has proved to be of its past. © 2006 British Ecological Society.},

  abstract = {We propose a method for optimizing sampling for digital soil mapping in cases where no directly measured prior information of the primary variable of interest is available. Various ancillary variables (soil series, relative elevation, slope, electrical conductivity and soil surface reflectance) were assumed to provide indirect information about the spatial distribution of soil carbon stock (CS, Mg ha- 1 in 0-0.3 m depth) in three fields of 49 to 65 ha size. The secondary information was used for stratifying each field into contiguous spatial clusters. Using this stratification, initial stratified random sampling schemes were allocated and further optimized by constrained spatial simulated annealing. Three optimization approaches were evaluated: minimization of the shortest distance (MMSD), a uniform distribution of point pairs for variogram estimation (WM), and a combination of MMSD (2 / 3 of samples) and WM (1 / 3). Spatially constrained cluster analysis of secondary information resulted in stratifications that accounted for large proportions of the variation of all ancillary variables used in the cluster analysis, but also for 47\% to 68\% of the spatial variation in measured CS. MMSD-optimized sampling schemes were inappropriate for mapping when the sampling density was low (??? 1.5 to 2 samples per hectare) because spatial variation occurring at short lag distances was poorly resolved. WM-optimized sampling schemes allowed modeling of spatial variation, but resulted in poor field coverage for mapping purposes. The combined MMSD + WM optimization provided both even field coverage and the ability to estimate variograms for interpolation purposes. Sampling based on secondary information and re-use of the secondary information in regression kriging increased the accuracy of CS maps and allowed a significant reduction in sample size without loss of information. Further improvements could include fitness functions that simultaneously account for variation in feature and geographic space as well as sampling cost. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Different geostatistical techniques for mapping CS in the top 0.3 m of soil with or without secondary information were assessed in three large no-till fields (49 to 65 ha) in Nebraska, which were sampled at a density of 3.9 to 4.2 samples ha- 1. Geostatistical methods evaluated were ordinary kriging (OK), co-kriging (COK), kriging with external drift (KED), and regression kriging (RK). Ancillary variables assumed to provide indirect information on spatial patterns of CS included maps of soil series, surface reflectance derived from satellite images (REF), relative elevation (EL), and soil electrical conductivity (EC). Root mean square error (RMSE) of CS predicted by OK ranged from 10.8 to 12.5 Mg C ha- 1 for the three sites. Methods that utilized secondary information reduced the RMSE by 5\% to 38\% compared to OK. Relative improvements in map accuracy were highest (16\% to 38\%) in multivariate regression kriging approaches, which also performed better than COK, KED, or RK methods that utilized only one ancillary variable. The relative gain from incorporating secondary information increased with decreasing sampling density. Reducing sampling intensity of CS to one half of the original samples increased the bias and RMSE of maps of CS produced by OK, whereas no or only little loss of map accuracy occurred in RK. Among the hybrid methods tested, RK performed best in terms of consistently increasing map accuracy and flexible modeling of the multivariate relationships between CS and secondary information. Among the ancillary variables, EC was most useful for CS mapping. Terrain attributes had limited value at the three study sites, while the value of REF depended on the surface conditions at the time of image acquisition. To reduce uncertainties, we recommend using independently measured, multivariate secondary information in RK approaches for mapping of soil organic carbon. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Using dominantly kaolinitic-illitic, smectitic and allophanic soils, we conducted systematic incubation experiments over 42 days at different temperatures (4, 22 and 37 °C) and moisture contents (30, 60 and 90\% of water holding capacity (available water)). The basal respiration was monitored to study the relative effect of moisture contents and temperature on the carbon protection capacities and mechanisms of the three clay types. The results indicated that carbon decomposition increased with increasing moisture and temperature. A two-component quadratic equation could explain the carbon mineralisation process. The highest C respiration was observed at 37 °C with a 60\% moisture level in each of the soil types. Under these conditions, the smectitic soil recorded the highest carbon decomposition followed by the kaolinitic-illitic and allophanic soils. The study of the priming effect using 14C labelled malic acid confirmed the trend of the bulk respiration results. The allophanic soil showed the lowest amount of carbon mineralisation under all experimental conditions. A strong inverse correlation (R2 = 0.90 at p {$<$} 0.05) was observed between CO2 emission rate and total sesquioxides (Fe and Al oxides) content. As evidenced by the pore size distribution, micromorphologies and thermogravimetric analyses, the microporous structure and microaggregate formation in the allophanic soil enhanced carbon sequestration. This study indicated that soil carbon stabilisation was related more to the sesquioxides content than to the clay types or their relative specific surface areas.},

CUE determines energy and material flows to higher trophic levels, conversion of plant-produced carbon into microbial products and rates of ecosystem carbon storage. Thermodynamic calculations support a maximum CUE value of \$\textbackslash sim\$ 0.60 (CUE max). Kinetic and stoichiometric constraints on microbial growth suggest that CUE in multi-resource limited natural systems should approach \$\textbackslash sim\$ 0.3 (CUE max /2). However, the mean CUE values reported for aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems differ by two-fold (\$\textbackslash sim\$ 0.26 vs. \$\textbackslash sim\$ 0.55) because the methods used to estimate CUE in aquatic and terrestrial systems gener-ally differ and soil estimates are less likely to capture the full maintenance costs of community metabolism given the difficulty of measurements in water-limited environments. Moreover, many simulation models lack adequate representation of energy spilling pathways and stoichiometric constraints on metabolism, which can also lead to overestimates of CUE. We recommend that broad-scale models use a CUE value of 0.30, unless there is evidence for lower values as a result of pervasive nutrient limitations. Ecosystem mod-els operating at finer scales should consider resource composition, stoichiometric constraints and biomass composition, as well as environmental drivers, to predict the CUE of microbial communities.},

A major force structuring ecological responses to these perturbations lies in the stoichiometric flexibility of systems - the ability to adjust their elemental balance whilst maintaining function. The potential for stoichiometric flexibility underscores the utility of the application of a framework highlighting the constraints and consequences of elemental mass balance and energy cycling in biological systems to address global change phenomena. Improvement in the modeling of ecological responses to disturbance requires the consideration of the stoichiometric flexibility of systems within and across relevant scales. Although a multitude of global change studies over various spatial and temporal scales exist, the explicit consideration of the role played by stoichiometric flexibility in linking micro-scale to macro-scale biogeochemical processes in terrestrial ecosystems remains relatively unexplored. Focusing on terrestrial systems under change, we discuss the mechanisms by which stoichiometric flexibility might be expressed and connected from organisms to ecosystems. We suggest that the transition from the expression of stoichiometric flexibility within individuals to the community and ecosystem scales is a key mechanism regulating the extent to which environmental perturbation may alter ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling dynamics.},

  abstract = {The relationship between soil structure and the ability of soil to stabilize soil organic matter (SOM) is a key element in soil C dynamics that has either been overlooked or treated in a cursory fashion when developing SOM models. The purpose of this paper is to review current knowledge of SOM dynamics within the framework of a newly proposed soil C saturation concept. Initially, we distinguish SOM that is protected against decomposition by various mechanisms from that which is not protected from decomposition. Methods of quantification and characteristics of three SOM pools defined as protected are discussed. Soil organic matter can be: (1) physically stabilized, or protected from decomposition, through microaggregation, or (2) intimate association with silt and clay particles, and (3) can be biochemically stabilized through the formation of recalcitrant SOM compounds. In addition to behavior of each SOM pool, we discuss implications of changes in land management on processes by which SOM compounds undergo protection and release. The characteristics and responses to changes in land use or land management are described for the light fraction (LF) and particulate organic matter (POM). We defined the LF and POM not occluded within microaggregates (53–250 µm sized aggregates as unprotected. Our conclusions are illustrated in a new conceptual SOM model that differs from most SOM models in that the model state variables are measurable SOM pools. We suggest that physicochemical characteristics inherent to soils define the maximum protective capacity of these pools, which limits increases in SOM (i.e. C sequestration) with increased organic residue inputs.},

  abstract = {Since the 1900s, the link between soil biotic activity, soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition and stabilization, and soil aggregate dynamics has been recognized and intensively been studied. By 1950, many studies had, mostly qualitatively, investigated the influence of the five major factors (i.e. soil fauna, microorganisms, roots, inorganics and physical processes) on this link. After 1950, four theoretical mile-stones related to this subject were realized. The first one was when Emerson [Nature 183 (1959) 538] proposed a model of a soil crumb consisting of domains of oriented clay and quartz particles. Next, Edwards and Bremner [J. Soil Sci. 18 (1967) 64] formulated a theory in which the solid-phase reaction between clay minerals, polyvalent cations and SOM is the main process leading to microaggregate formation. Based on this concept, Tisdall and Oades [J. Soil Sci. 62 (1982) 141] coined the aggregate hierarchy concept describing a spatial scale dependence of mechanisms involved in micro- and macroaggregate formation. Oades [Plant Soil 76 (1984) 319] suggested a small, but very important, modification to the aggregate hierarchy concept by theorizing the formation of microaggregates within macroaggregates. Recent research on aggregate formation and SOM stabilization extensively corroborate this modification and use it as the base for furthering the understanding of SOM dynamics. The major outcomes of adopting this modification are: (1) microaggregates, rather than macroaggregates protect SOM in the long term; and (2) macroaggregate turnover is a crucial process influencing the stabilization of SOM. Reviewing the progress made over the last 50 years in this area of research reveals that still very few studies are quantitative and/or consider interactive effects between the five factors. The quantification of these relationships is clearly needed to improve our ability to predict changes in soil ecosystems due to management and global change. This quantification can greatly benefit from viewing aggregates as dynamic rather than static entities and relating aggregate measurements with 2D and 3D quantitative spatial information. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Our 2000 paper Soil macroaggregate turnover and microaggregate formation: A mechanism for C sequestration under no-tillage agriculture had its genesis in attempts to identify and isolate soil organic matter (SOM) fractions that reflect the impacts of climate, soil physiochemical properties and physical disturbance on the soil organic carbon balance. A key prerequisite for the investigation was the development of a simple device to isolate the microaggregates (53-250??m) contained within stable (i.e., resistant to slaking) macroaggregates ({$>$}250??m) obtained by conventional wet-sieving. By comparing the abundance and C content of micro-within-macroaggregates, the size distribution of intra-aggregate particulate organic matter (iPOM) and isotopically-based estimates of the age of the organic matter in the different fractions, we were able to corroborate our hypothesis that the absence of tillage (i.e., in no-till and native soils) promotes greater longevity of newly-formed macroaggregates, resulting in greater SOM stabilization in microaggregates formed within stable macroaggregates. Follow-up research has indicated that the microaggregate-within-macroaggregate fraction is 1) potentially a robust indicator for management-induced SOC changes over decadal time scales, 2) of biological origin and therefore useful in interpreting impacts of soil biota on soil C and N dynamics, but not in-situ CO2 and N2O fluxes, 3) useful in complimentary chemical and spectroscopic approaches to relate SOM dynamics to soil structure and attributes of the soil pore space, and 4) a good candidate for being incorporated into models as a measurable fraction. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Wetting of dry soil triggers a pulse of microbial respiration that has been attributed to two broad mechanisms: (1) recycling of microbial cellular carbon (C), and (2) consumption of extracellular organic C made available to microbes by wetting. We evaluated these two mechanisms by measuring cumulative CO2 release, changes in the size and chemical composition of microbial biomass, and water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC) concentrations following artificial wetting of soil sampled from two depths at each of seven sites across California spanning a range of geologic parent materials. In samples collected from surface soil (0–10 cm depth), we found that cumulative CO2 release after wetting in the laboratory was most strongly correlated with microbial biomass. In these samples, the relative abundance of trehalose—a putative microbial osmolyte—decreased from 25\% (SD = 12) to 16\% (SD = 7) of the chloroform-labile fraction of the microbial biomass after wetting. This suggested a role for osmolyte consumption in generating the respiration pulse. In subsoil (40–50 cm depth, or sampled at contact with rock), however, the cumulative CO2 release after wetting was unrelated to microbial biomass and more strongly related to WEOC. The concentrations of selected microbial biomass constituents (e.g. trehalose and amino acids) in WEOC were negligible ({$<$} 1\%), suggesting that cell lysis was not important in generating WEOC in this study. The amount of WEOC relative to total organic C was greatest in subsoil, and negatively related to ammonium oxalate-extractable Fe (Pearson's R = 0.42, p {$<$} 0.01), suggesting a role for soil mineralogical properties in controlling WEOC release. Together, these findings suggest that microbial cellular C and extracellular C jointly contribute to the respiration pulse, and that their relative contribution depends on depth.},

By implication, the abundance of primary minerals in soil might influence the abundance of poorly crystalline minerals, and hence soil organic carbon storage. However, the link between primary mineral weathering, poorly crystalline minerals, and soil carbon has not been fully tested, particularly at large spatial scales. To close this knowledge gap, we designed a model that links primary mineral weathering rates to the geographic distribution of poorly crystalline minerals across the USA, and then used this model to evaluate the effect of rock weathering on soil organic carbon. We found that poorly crystalline minerals are most abundant and most strongly correlated with organic carbon in geographically limited zones that sustain enhanced weathering rates, where humid climate and abundant primary minerals co-occur. This finding confirms that rock weathering alters soil mineralogy to enhance soil organic carbon storage at continental scales, but also indicates that the influence of active weathering on soil carbon storage is limited by low weathering rates across vast areas.},

Fine soil was mixed with either coarse soil, or the equivalent volume of inert glass chips, in ratios identical to those occurring naturally in soil sampled from two depths at each of two sites. Seedlings of Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides and Weinmannia racemosa were planted in the soil mixtures and harvested after 9 months. The content of nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, magnesium and other elements in the above ground seedling tissue was significantly increased by the presence of coarse soil. The coarse soil fraction also contributed proportionally much more to plant nutrient uptake than fine soil on a mass per mass basis. Coarse soil is excluded from conventional soil analysis, so is possible that soil nutrient capital is systematically underestimated. This has implications for land management and studies of plant dynamics in relation to nutrient supply.},

  abstract = {Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 1 methodologies commonly underpin project-scale carbon accounting for changes in land use and management and are used in frameworks for Life Cycle Assessment and carbon footprinting of food and energy crops. These methodologies were intended for use at large spatial scales. This can introduce error in predictions at finer spatial scales. There is an urgent need for development and implementation of higher tier methodologies that can be applied at fine spatial scales (e.g. farm/project/plantation) for food and bioenergy crop greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting to facilitate decision making in the land-based sectors. Higher tier methods have been defined by IPCC and must be well evaluated and operate across a range of domains (e.g. climate region, soil type, crop type, topography), and must account for land use transitions and management changes being implemented. Furthermore, the data required to calibrate and drive the models used at higher tiers need to be available and applicable at fine spatial resolution, covering the meteorological, soil, cropping system and management domains, with quantified uncertainties. Testing the reliability of the models will require data either from sites with repeated measurements or from chronosequences. We review current global capability for estimating changes in soil carbon at fine spatial scales and present a vision for a framework capable of quantifying land use change and management impacts on soil carbon, which could be used for addressing issues such as bioenergy and biofuel sustainability, food security, forest protection, and direct/indirect impacts of land use change. The aim of this framework is to provide a globally accepted standard of carbon measurement and modelling appropriate for GHG accounting that could be applied at project to national scales (allowing outputs to be scaled up to a country level), to address the impacts of land use and land management change on soil carbon.},

The number of publications on soil organic matter has increased greatly in recent decades; for example, there were almost 35 000 journal papers with this theme in the decade 2007–2016. Several topics in research on soil organic matter, such as soil fertility, have endured for a number of decades, with publications found on soil organic matter and fertility in the decade 1947–1956. A search with other keywords occurring with soil, such as climate change, biodiversity, fertility, quality, health and security, showed that several topics did not appear before the 1970s and 1980s, but since then the sub-topics and applications have diversified. Carbon is a keyword that has become more associated with publications on soil organic matter; carbon is in over half of soil organic matter publications of the last decade. A closer examination of research on agricultural soil carbon sequestration since 1990 reveals that the focus of papers in the literature has changed over this period. A closer examination of papers on modelling shows that the next generation of soil organic matter models is developing from pseudo first-order decay models using conceptual pools and prescribed controls ofturnover time to vertically resolved, microbially explicit models representing mineral surface and plant interactions. Given its higher policy profile during the last 2 years, research on soil organic matter and soil carbon sequestration is predicted to have a bright future.},

Since SOC content of soils cannot be easily measured, a key barrier to implementing programmes to increase SOC at large scale, is the need for credible and reliable measurement/monitoring, reporting and verifica‐ tion (MRV) platforms, both for national reporting and for emissions trading. Without such platforms, investments could be considered risky. In this paper, we review meth‐ ods and challenges of measuring SOC change directly in soils, before examining some recent novel developments that show promise for quantifying SOC. We describe how repeat soil surveys are used to estimate changes in SOC over time, and how long‐term experiments and space‐for‐time substitution sites can serve as sources of knowledge and can be used to test models, and as potential benchmark sites in global frameworks to estimate SOC change. We briefly consider models that can be used to simulate and project change in SOC and examine the MRV platforms for SOC change already in use in various countries/regions. In the final section, we bring together the various components described in this review, to describe a new vision for a global framework for MRV of SOC change, to support national and international initiatives seeking to effect change in the way we manage our soils.},

We compared two-stage density fractionation (isolating free and intra-aggregate fractions, be- fore and after dispersion, respectively) with particle-size separation of dispersed soil. For full comparison, the organomineral fraction residual from density fractionation was also size separated. In stand- ardizing the density-based method, we found recovery of intra-aggre- gate organic matter highly sensitive to separation density as compared with the free. Recovery of the intra-aggregate was also influenced by dispersion energy. The greatest amount was obtained using a combina- tion of the highest density (1.80 g cm?3 ) and dispersion energy (1500 Jg?1 ). Analysis by 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) showed O-alkyl/alkyl-C ratios 1.38 to 2.30 times greater in intra-aggregate organic matter than in the free. Diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFT) also indicated a greater proportion of aliphatic hydrocarbon, carboxylic anions, and aromatic C in intra- aggregate organic matter. The findings suggest this fraction comprises more decomposed and transformed organic matter relative to the free. Higher signal/noise ratios in NMR spectra of particle-size fractions (compared with their organomineral equivalents) were attributed to Cin particulate SOM,not removed by prior density separation. Whilst particle-size fractions confuse particulate SOM with that attached to mineral surfaces, fractions isolated by two-stage density separation are small innumber and display distinct chemical properties.Wesuggest they provide a sound basis for a model of SOM turnover based on measurable pools.},

The belowground rhizosphere pathway (that is, carbon exiting the living root) is theorized to form stable soil carbon more efficiently than the aboveground pathway. However, while several mechanisms have been invoked to explain this efficiency, few have been empirically tested or quantified. Here, we use soil microcosms with standardized carbon inputs to investigate three posited mechanisms that differentiate aboveground from belowground input pathways of dissolved organic carbon—through the microbial biomass—to the mineral-stabilized soil organic carbon pool: (1) the physical distance travelled, (2) the microbial abundance in the region in which a carbon compound enters (that is, rhizosphere versus bulk soil) and (3) the frequency and volume of carbon delivery (that is, infrequent ‘pulse' versus frequent ‘drip'). We demonstrate that through the microbial formation pathway, belowground inputs form mineral-stabilized soil carbon more efficiently than aboveground inputs, partly due to the greater efficiency of formation by the rhizosphere microbial community relative to the bulk soil community. However, we show that because the bulk soil has greater capacity to form mineral-stabilized soil carbon due to its greater overall volume, the relative contributions of aboveground versus belowground carbon inputs depend strongly on the ratio of rhizosphere to bulk soil.},

Recent theory suggests that living root inputs exert a disproportionate influence on SOC formation, but few field studies have explicitly tested this by separately tracking living root vs litter inputs as they move through the soil food web and into distinct SOC pools. We used a manipulative field experiment with an annual C4 grass in a forest understory to differentially track its living root vs litter inputs into the soil and to assess net SOC formation over multiple years. We show that living root inputs are 2–13 times more efficient than litter inputs in forming both slow‐cycling, mineral‐associated SOC as well as fast‐cycling, particulate organic C. Furthermore, we demonstrate that living root inputs are more efficiently anabolized by the soil microbial community en route to the mineral‐associated SOC pool (dubbed ‘the in vivo microbial turnover pathway'). Overall, our findings provide support for the primacy of living root inputs in forming SOC. However, we also highlight the possibility of nonadditive effects of living root and litter inputs, which may deplete SOC pools despite greater SOC formation rates.},

  abstract = {To predict the behavior of the terrestrial carbon cycle, it is critical to understand the source, formation pathway, and chemical composition of soil organic matter (SOM). There is emerging consensus that slow‐cycling SOM generally consists of relatively low molecular weight organic carbon substrates that enter the mineral soil as dissolved organic matter and associate with mineral surfaces (referred to as “mineral‐associated OM,” or MAOM). However, much debate and contradictory evidence persist around: (a) whether the organic C substrates within the MAOM pool primarily originate from aboveground vs. belowground plant sources and (b) whether C substrates directly sorb to mineral surfaces or undergo microbial transformation prior to their incorporation into MAOM. Here, we attempt to reconcile disparate views on the formation of MAOM by proposing a spatially explicit set of processes that link plant C source with MAOM formation pathway. Specifically, because belowground vs. aboveground sources of plant C enter spatially distinct regions of the mineral soil, we propose that fine‐scale differences in microbial abundance should determine the probability of substrate–microbe vs. substrate–mineral interaction. Thus, formation of MAOM in areas of high microbial density (e.g., the rhizosphere and other microbial hotspots) should primarily occur through an in vivo microbial turnover pathway and favor C substrates that are first biosynthesized with high microbial carbon‐use efficiency prior to incorporation in the MAOM pool. In contrast, in areas of low microbial density (e.g., certain regions of the bulk soil), MAOM formation should primarily occur through the direct sorption of intact or partially oxidized plant compounds to uncolonized mineral surfaces, minimizing the importance of carbon‐use efficiency, and favoring C substrates with strong “sorptive affinity.” Through this framework, we thus describe how the primacy of biotic vs. abiotic controls on MAOM dynamics is not mutually exclusive, but rather spatially dictated. Such an understanding may be integral to more accurately modeling soil organic matter dynamics across different spatial scales.},

  abstract = {Soil microorganisms shape global element cycles in life and death. Living soil microorganisms are a major engine of terrestrial biogeochemistry, driving the turnover of soil organic matter — Earth's largest terrestrial carbon pool and the primary source of plant nutrients. Their metabolic functions are influenced by ecological interactions with other soil microbial populations, soil fauna and plants, and the surrounding soil environment. Remnants of dead microbial cells serve as fuel for these biogeochemical engines because their chemical constituents persist as soil organic matter. This non-living microbial biomass accretes over time in soil, forming one of the largest pools of organic matter on the planet. In this Review, we discuss how the biogeochemical cycling of organic matter depends on both living and dead soil microorganisms, their functional traits, and their interactions with the soil matrix and other organisms. With recent omics advances, many of the traits that frame microbial population dynamics and their ecophysiological adaptations can be deciphered directly from assembled genomes or patterns of gene or protein expression. Thus, it is now possible to leverage a trait-based understanding of microbial life and death within improved biogeochemical models and to better predict ecosystem functioning under new climate regimes.},

  abstract = {In mineral soil, organic matter (OM) accumulates mainly on and around surfaces of silt- and clay-size particles. When fractionated according to particle density, C and N concentration (per g fraction) and C/N of these soil organo-mineral particles decrease with increasing particle density across soils of widely divergent texture, mineralogy, location, and management. The variation in particle density is explained potentially by two factors: (1) a decrease in the mass ratio of organic to mineral phase of these particles, and (2) variations in density of the mineral phase. The first explanation implies that the thickness of the organic accumulations decreases with increasing particle density. The decrease in C/N can be explained at least partially by especially stable sorption of nitrogenous N-containing compounds (amine, amide, and pyrrole) directly to mineral surfaces, a phenomenon well documented both empirically and theoretically. These peptidic compounds, along with ligand-exchanged carboxylic compounds, could then form a stable inner organic layer onto which other organics could sorb more readily than onto the unconditioned mineral surfaces ("onion" layering model). To explore mechanisms underlying this trend in C concentration and C/N with particle density, we sequentially density fractionated an Oregon andic soil at 1.65, 1.85, 2.00, 2.28, and 2.55 g cm-3 and analyzed the six fractions for measures of organic matter and mineral phase properties. All measures of OM composition showed either: (1) a monotonic change with density, or (2) a monotonic change across the lightest fractions, then little change over the heaviest fractions. Total C, N, and lignin phenol concentration all decreased monotonically with increasing density, and 14C mean residence time (MRT) increased with particle density from ca. 150 years to {$>$}980 years in the four organo-mineral fractions. In contrast, C/N, 13C and 15N concentration all showed the second pattern. All these data are consistent with a general pattern of an increase in extent of microbial processing with increasing organo-mineral particle density, and also with an "onion" layering model. X-ray diffraction before and after separation of magnetic materials showed that the sequential density fractionation (SDF) isolated pools of differing mineralogy, with layer-silicate clays dominating in two of the intermediate fractions and primary minerals in the heaviest two fractions. There was no indication that these differences in mineralogy controlled the differences in density of the organo-mineral particles in this soil. Thus, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that variation in particle density reflects variation in thickness of the organic accumulations and with an "onion" layering model for organic matter accumulation on mineral surfaces. However, the mineralogy differences among fractions made it difficult to test either the layer-thickness or "onion" layering models with this soil. Although SDF isolated pools of distinct mineralogy and organic-matter composition, more work will be needed to understand mechanisms relating the two factors.},

  abstract = {Sequential density fractionation separated soil particles into "light" predominantly mineral-free organic matter vs. increasingly "heavy" organo-mineral particles in four soils of widely differing mineralogy. With increasing particle density C concentration decreased, implying that the soil organic matter (OM) accumulations were thinner. With thinner accumulations we saw evidence for both an increase in 14C-based mean residence time (MRT) of the OM and a shift from plant to microbial origin.Evidence for the latter included: (1) a decrease in C/N, (2) a decrease in lignin phenols and an increase in their oxidation state, and (3) an increase in ?13C and ?15N. Although bulk-soil OM levels varied substantially across the four soils, trends in OM composition and MRT across the density fractions were similar. In the intermediate density fractions (\$\textbackslash sim\$1.8-2.6 g cm-3), most of the reactive sites available for interaction with organic molecules were provided by aluminosilicate clays, and OM characteristics were consistent with a layered mode of OM accumulation. With increasing density (lower OM loading) within this range, OM showed evidence of an increasingly microbial origin. We hypothesize that this microbially derived OM was young at the time of attachment to the mineral surfaces but that it persisted due to both binding with mineral surfaces and protection beneath layers of younger, less microbially processed C. As a result of these processes, the OM increased in MRT, oxidation state, and degree of microbial processing in the sequentially denser intermediate fractions. Thus mineral surface chemistry is assumed to play little role in determining OM composition in these intermediate fractions. As the separation density was increased beyond \$\textbackslash sim\$2.6 g cm-3, mineralogy shifted markedly: aluminosilicate clays gave way first to light primary minerals including quartz, then at even higher densities to various Fe-bearing primary minerals. Correspondingly, we observed a marked drop in ?15N, a weaker decrease in extent of microbial processing of lignin phenols, and some evidence of a rise in C/N ratio. At the same time, however, 14C-based MRT time continued its increase. The increase in MRT, despite decreases in degree of microbial alteration, suggests that mineral surface composition (especially Fe concentration) plays a strong role in determining OM composition across these two densest fractions. ?

By altering plant species diversity and composition, soil conditions and nutrient availability, and consequently belowground allocation and dynamics of root carbon (C) inputs, land-use and management changes may influence organic C storage in terrestrial ecosystems. In three German regions, we measured fine root radiocarbon (14C) content to estimate the mean time since C in root tissues was fixed from the atmosphere in 54 grassland and forest plots with different management and soil conditions. Although root biomass was on average greater in grasslands 5.1 ± 0.8 g (mean ± SE, Combining double low line 27) than in forests 3.1 ± 0.5 g (n Combining double low line 27) (p/0.05), the mean age of C in fine roots in forests averaged 11.3 ± 1.8 yr and was older and more variable compared to grasslands 1.7 ± 0.4 yr (ip {$<$} 0.001). We further found that management affects the mean age of fine root C in temperate grasslands mediated by changes in plant species diversity and composition. Fine root mean C age is positively correlated with plant diversity (Combining double low line 0.65) and with the number of perennial species ( Combining double low line 0.77). Fine root mean C age in grasslands was also affected by study region with averages of 0.7 ± 0.1 yr ( Combining double low line 9) on mostly organic soils in northern Germany and of 1.8 ± 0.3 yr (n Combining double low line 9) and 2.6 ± 0.3 (n/Combining double low line 9) in central and southern Germany (ip/i0.05). This was probably due to differences in soil nutrient contents and soil moisture conditions between study regions, which affected plant species diversity and the presence of perennial species. Our results indicate more long-lived roots or internal redistribution of C in perennial species and suggest linkages between fine root C age and management in grasslands. These findings improve our ability to predict and model belowground C fluxes across broader spatial scales. © 2012 Author(s).},

  abstract = {Background and aims: Fine root decomposition contributes significantly to element cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. However, studies on root decomposition rates and on the factors that potentially influence them are fewer than those on leaf litter decomposition. To study the effects of region and land use intensity on fine root decomposition, we established a large scale study in three German regions with different climate regimes and soil properties. Methods In 150 forest and 150 grassland sites we deployed litterbags (100 μm mesh size) with standardized litter consisting of fine roots from European beech in forests and from a lowland mesophilous hay meadow in grasslands. In the central study region, we compared decomposition rates of this standardized litter with root litter collected on-site to separate the effect of litter quality from environmental factors. Results: Standardized herbaceous roots in grassland soils decomposed on average significantly faster (24 ± 6 \% mass loss after 12 months, mean ± SD) than beech roots in forest soils (12 ± 4 \%; p {$<$} 0.001). Fine root decomposition varied among the three study regions. Land use intensity, in particular N addition, decreased fine root decomposition in grasslands. The initial lignin:N ratio explained 15 \% of the variance in grasslands and 11 \% in forests. Soil moisture, soil temperature, and C:N ratios of soils together explained 34 \% of the variance of the fine root mass loss in grasslands, and 24 \% in forests. Conclusions: Grasslands, which have higher fine root biomass and root turnover compared to forests, also have higher rates of root decomposition. Our results further show that at the regional scale fine root decomposition is influenced by environmental variables such as soil moisture, soil temperature and soil nutrient content. Additional variation is explained by root litter quality. © 2014 The Author(s).},

The loss of subsoil carbon was primarily from unprotected particulate organic matter. Warming also stimulated a sustained 30 ± 4\% increase in soil CO2 efflux due to increased CO2 production through the whole-soil profile. The observed in situ decline in subsoil carbon stocks with warming is now definitive evidence of a positive soil carbon-climate feedback, which could not be concluded based on increases in CO2 effluxes alone. The high sensitivity of subsoil carbon and the different responses of soil organic matter pools suggest that models must represent these heterogeneous soil dynamics to accurately predict future feedbacks to warming.},

  abstract = {A variety of landscape properties have been modelled successfully using topographic indices such as the topographic wetness index (TWI), defined as ln(a/tan β), where a is the specific upslope area and β is the surface slope. Previous studies have shown the influence of scale on TWI values when converting standard-resolution DEMs to coarser resolutions. In this study a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) with a 5 m grid size derived from LIDAR (light detection and ranging) data was used to investigate the scale-dependency of TWI values when converting from high-resolution elevation data to standard-resolution DEMs. First, a set of DEMs was generated from an initial DEM by thinning to resolutions of 10, 25, and 50 m grid sizes to study the effects of lower grid size and decreased information content. Next, to investigate the impact of different information content on DEMs with the same grid size, the three lower resolution DEMs were all interpolated to the original 5 m grid size. In addition to comparing index distribution functions, a second objective was to evaluate differences in spatial patterns. Thus the values of TWI and its components as computed for the seven different DEMs were compared in three different ways: (1) distribution functions and their statistics; (2) cell by cell comparison of four DEMs with the same resolution but different information content; and (3) comparison of blocks of cells within different resolution DEMs with different information content. Like previous TWI studies, the computed specific upstream area decreased on average for higher resolution DEMs while computed slope values followed a narrower distribution. TWI variation between neighbouring cells in 50 × 50 m areas decreased largely with increasing grid size. A cell by cell comparison of the TWI values of the four 5 m DEMs with different information content showed a clear decrease in correlation with the TWI based on the original DEM with decreasing information content. The results showed considerable differences between topographic indices computed for DEMs of different grid resolution. Interpolating the DEMs to a higher resolution (i.e. a smaller grid size) provided more similar TWI distributions, but the pixel by pixel comparison showed that different information contents caused clearly different TWI maps. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

However, there is still no widely accepted standard method to assess SOC lability and the pertinence of these two time-consuming methods to characterize SOC turnover can be questioned. Alternate ways of determining the labile SOC fraction are thus much needed. Thermal analyses, in particular Rock-Eval 6 (RE6) analysis has shown promising results in the determination of SOC biogeochemical stability. Using a large set of samples (n = 99) of French forest soils representing contrasted pedoclimatic conditions, including deep samples (up to 0.8 m depth), we compared three different methods used for SOC lability assessment. We explored whether respired-C isolated by a 10-week laboratory soil respiration test, POM-C isolated by a physical SOC fractionation scheme (particle-size {$>$} 50 μm and d {$<$} 1.6 g cm−3) and several RE6 parameters were comparable and how they correlated. As expected, respired-C (mg CO2-C·g−1 SOC) and POM-C (\% of total SOC) fractions strongly decreased with depth. RE6 parameters showed that SOC from deeper soil layers was also thermally less labile, more oxidized and H-depleted. Indeed, SOC from deeper soil layers had lower proportion of thermally labile SOC, higher T50\_HC\_PYR (temperature at which 50\% of the pyrolysable hydrocarbons were effectively pyrolyzed) and T50\_CO2\_OX (temperature at which 50\% of the CO2 gas had evolved during the oxidation phase), larger oxygen index, and smaller hydrogen index. Surprisingly, the two classical indicators of the labile SOC pool (respired-C and POM-C) were only marginally correlated (p = 0.051) and showed layer-specific correlations. Similarly, respired-C was poorly correlated to RE6 parameters. Conversely, the POM-C fraction showed a strong negative correlation with T50\_HC\_PYR (ρ = −0.73) and good correlations with other RE6 parameters. Our study showed that RE6 parameters were good estimates of the POM-C fraction, which represents a labile SOC pool with a residence time of ca. a couple decades that is meaningful regarding SOC stock changes upon modifications in land management. RE6 thermal analysis could therefore be a fast and cost-effective alternative to more time-consuming methods used in SOC pool determination, and may be integrated into soil monitoring networks to provide high-throughput information on SOC dynamics.},

  abstract = {Al-/Fe(hydr)oxides accumulation upon weathering favors soil organic carbon (SOC) protection into mineral-organic associations (MOAs). Paradoxically, tropical ecosystems on highly weathered soils are characterized by high turnover rates of SOC. Our objective was to propose an explanation for such apparent contradiction by inferring the chemical composition of MOAs in Oxisols. To this end, we compiled a large data set from 43 published articles providing chemical and physical properties of 179 Oxisols/Ferralsols and their SOC content in the A horizon. Thermal analysis (TA) coupled to evolved gas detection (EGD) was used to assess mineral dehydroxylation and SOC oxidation in two soils with contrasting SOC content. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was used to probe MOAs within the soil fraction {$<$} 53 μm. At large scales, SOC content was strongly correlated to Al extractable by both ammonium oxalate (AO) (r = 0.71) and dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate (DCB) (r = 0.41). Weaker, but significant correlations occurred for SOC against Fe-AO and Fe-DCB (r = 0.38, and r = 014, respectively). At micro-scale, SOC also was found associated to Al-/Fe-(hydr)oxides, as inferred from the STEM imaging. TA-EGD indicated that with increasing SOC content, proportionally more organic matter was oxidized following the dehydroxylation of Al-/Fe-(hydr)oxides at temperatures {$<$} 400 °C. Within the first 20 cm of the topsoil of the Oxisols included in our data set, Al-AO explained 62\% of the total variation in SOC. However, while SOC content varied from 0.8 up to 145.8 g kg− 1 soil, Al-AO varied between 0.2 and 15.3 g kg− 1 soil. From the perspective of mineral control on SOC retention, reactive species of Al-(hydr)oxides should interact with a disproportionally large amount of organic matter.

  abstract = {Minerals with large specific surface areas promote the stabilization of soil organic matter (SOM). We analysed three acidic soils (dystric, skeletic Leptic Cambisol; dystric, laxic Leptic Cambisol; skeletic Leptic Entic Podzol) under Norway spruce (Picea abies) forest with different mineral compositions to determine the effects of soil type on carbon (C) stabilization in soil. The relationship between the amount and chemical composition of soil organic matter (SOM), clay content, oxalate-extractable Fe and Al (Feo; Alo), and dithionite-extractable Fe (Fed) before and after treatment with 10\% hydrofluoric acid (HF) in topsoil and subsoil horizons was analysed. Radiocarbon age, 13C CPMAS NMR spectra, lignin phenol content and neutral sugar content in the soils before and after HF-treatment were determined and com- pared for bulk soil samples and particle size separates. Changes in the chemical composition of SOM after HF-treatment were small for the A-horizons. In contrast, for B-horizons, HF-soluble (mineral- associated) and HF-resistant (non-mineral-associated) SOM showed systematic differences in functional C groups. The non-mineral associated SOM in the B-horizons was significantly depleted in microbially- derived sugars, and the contribution of O/N-alkyl C to total organic C was less after HF-treatment. The radiocarbon age of the mineral-associated SOM was younger than that of the HF-resistant SOM in subsoil horizons with small amounts of oxalate-extractable Al and Fe. However, in horizons with large amounts of oxalate-extractable Al and Fe the HF-soluble SOM was considerably older than the HF-resistant SOM. In acid subsoils a specific fraction of the organic C pool (O/N-alkyl C; microbially- derived sugars) is preferentially stabilized by association with Fe and Al minerals. Stabilization of SOM with the mineral matrix in soils with large amounts of oxalate-extractable Alo and Feo results in a par- ticularly stable and relatively old C pool, which is potentially stable for thousands of years.}

  abstract = {Processing of organic carbon (C) by soil microorganisms is a key process of terrestrial C cycling. For this reason we studied (i) microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) defined as C allocated to growth over organic C taken up by the microbial community, and (ii) the turnover time of microbial biomass in a pasture and in two forest soils. We hypothesized that microbial CUE decreases in mineral soils with depth from the topsoil to the subsoil, while the turnover time of the microbial biomass increases due to energetic constrains. We determined microbial CUE and turnover of microbial biomass C using a novel substrate-independent method based on incorporation of18O from labeled water into microbial DNA with concurrent measurements of basal respiration. Microorganisms showed decreasing C uptake rates with decreasing C contents in the deeper soil layers. In the forest soils, no adaptation of microbial CUE with soil depth took place, i.e., microbes in the forest topsoil used C at the same efficiency as microbes in the subsoil. However, in the pasture soil, microbial CUE decreased in the lower soil layers compared to the topsoil, indicating that microorganisms in the deeper soil layers allocated relatively more C to respiration. In the organic soil layer, microorganisms respired more per unit microbial biomass C than in the subsoil, but had a similar CUE despite the high C-to-nitrogen and C-to-phosphorus ratios of the litter layers. The turnover time of microbial biomass increased with soil depth in the two forest soils. Thus, in the forest soils, a lower microbial C uptake rate in the deeper soil layers was partially compensated by a longer turnover time of microbial biomass C. In conclusion, our findings emphasize that in addition to microbial CUE, the turnover time of the microbial biomass strongly affects soil C cycling.},

  abstract = {We examined relative changes in soil C pools shortly after the establishment of six perennial and two annual bioenergy cropping systems that differed in diversity (monoculture vs. polyculture). Perennial systems included two monocultures (switchgrass, Panicum virgatum; and miscanthus, Miscanthus × giganteus) and four polycultures including hybrid poplar (Populus sp.) + herbaceous understory; mixed native grasses, successional vegetation, and restored prairie. Two annual systems included no-till continuous corn (Zea mays) and rotational corn (corn-soybean (Glycine max)-canola (Brassica napus)). Each crop was planted in a full factorial design at both a moderate fertility Alfisol and a high fertility Mollisol site. Relative differences in active, slow, and passive C pools in surface soils, where C changes are most likely to be detected early, were evaluated with 322-day laboratory incubations followed by acid hydrolysis to infer different pools from exponential decay curves. Five years post-establishment, active C pools under perennial polycultures at the Alfisol site were up to twice those under annual and perennial monocultures, and followed the order hybrid poplars (696 ± 216 μg C g− 1 soil, n = 5 replicate blocks) ≈ native grasses (656 ± 155) ≈ restored prairie (638 ± 44) {$>$} early successional (500 ± 54) ≫ continuous corn (237 ± 68) ≈ rotational corn (180 ± n.a.). Active C pools in perennial monocultures were similar to those in continuous corn: switchgrass (274 ± 29) ≈ miscanthus (299 ± 9). In contrast, differences in active C pools among crops at the more fertile Mollisol site were not detectable except for greater pools in the restored prairie and rotational corn systems. At both sites, slow and passive C pools differed little among systems except that slow pools were greater in the poplar system. That diversity rather than perenniality itself led to greater active C pools suggests that polycultures might be used to accelerate soil C accumulation in bioenergy and other perennial cropping systems.},

  abstract = {Enrichment of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks through sequestration of atmospheric CO2 in agricultural soils is important because of its impacts on soil quality, agronomic production, and adaptation to and mitigation of climate change. In a 21-yr field experiment conducted under subhumid tropical conditions in India, the impacts of crop residue C inputs were assessed for the rice (Oryza sativa L.)-lentil (Lens esculenta Moench) cropping sequence. These impacts were evaluated in an experiment involving mineral fertilizers and manuring treatments on crop yield sustainability with reference to critical biomass requirements for maintenance of SOC in an Inceptisol. Application of farmyard manure (FYM) without and with mineral fertilizers increased C input and SOC concentration and stock. In comparison with the control, the 100\% organic (FYM) treatment had significantly higher profile SOC (27.5 Mg ha(-1)), and more C build up (55.0\%) and C sequestration (6.6 Mg C ha(-1)) to 1-m depth vis-a-vis the antecedent values in 1986. These parameters were also higher in 100\% FYM treatment at a rate providing equivalent amount of the recommended dose of N followed by conjunctive use of FYM and mineral fertilizers. The SOC stock and rate of sequestration were positively correlated with cumulative C input, and with sustainable yield index (SYI) of upland rice and lentil. Higher grain yield (1.95 and 1.04 Mg ha(-1) of rice and lentil, respectively) was obtained with the application of 50\% organic (FYM)+50\% recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF). In comparison, higher SOC sequestration rate was measured with the application of 100\% organic (FYM). For every Mg increase in SOC stock in the root zone there was 0.16 and 0.18 Mg ha(-1)yr(-1) yield increase of rice and lentil, respectively. For maintaining a stable SOC level (zero change due to cropping), a minimum quantity of 2.47 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) is required for this soil, climate, cropping system, and fertilization treatments. To achieve this quantity of C, 7.1 Mg of biomass is required to be produced every year vs. average rice and lentil yields of 1.6 and 0.7 Mg ha(-1), respectively. The sole application of mineral fertilizers at 50 or 100\% of the RDF did not maintain the SOC stock. Thus, application of FYM (or other organics) in conjunction with mineral fertilizers is essential to maintaining and enhancing the SOC stock in the rice-based cropping systems.},

However, this broad subdivision groups together types of intershrub surface cover that may also differ in their soil properties and play important roles in ecosystem functioning. In the northern Negev region of Israel, we examined the soil properties associated with flock trampling routes and rock fragment clusters, as well as those associated with the remainder of the intershrub area and shrub patches. Moisture content, organic carbon content, bulk density and calcium carbonate content of the soil were determined for the above four types of cover, inside and outside long-term grazing exclosures. Soil was sampled in the peak of the growing season and in the end of the dry season, on a north- and a south-facing hillside, and from two depths. The shrub patches exhibited the highest soil moisture and organic carbon contents, and the lowest bulk density and calcium carbonate contents. The trampling routes showed opposite trends. The rock fragment clusters and the remainder of the intershrub area did not generally differ and had intermediate values of these properties. Grazing did not have a significant effect on soil properties at the whole-plot scale, but there were highly significant interactions between grazing and type of cover. Compared with the former trampling routes in the exclosures, the active trampling routes outside them had higher bulk density and lower moisture and organic carbon contents. The intershrub area had higher moisture and organic carbon contents under grazing than in the exclosures. Grazing increased the spatial heterogeneity of the soil properties examined via the creation of a network of trampling routes on the hillsides. The routes themselves, which constituted over 20\% of the landscape cover, had degraded soil properties but they led to the improvement of the properties of the remainder of the intershrub area via functionally important source-sink relationships. The study of the soil of regions in which such networks are apparent should be duly cognizant of this intershrub subdivision in addition to the widely recognized shrub-intershrub dichotomy. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Fire is one of the most important natural disturbance processes in the western United States and ecosystems differ markedly with respect to their ecological and evolutionary relationships with fire. Reference fire regimes in forested ecosystems can be categorized along a gradient ranging from ?fuel-limited? to ?climate-limited? where the former types are often characterized by frequent, lower-severity wildfires and the latter by infrequent, more severe wildfires. Using spatial data on fire severity from 1984?2011 and metrics related to fire frequency, we tested how divergence from historic (pre-Euroamerican settlement) fire frequencies due to a century of fire suppression influences rates of high-severity fire in five forest types in California. With some variation among bioregions, our results suggest that fires in forest types characterized by fuel-limited fire regimes (e.g., yellow pine and mixed conifer forest) tend to burn with greater proportions of high-severity fire as either time since last fire or the mean modern fire return interval (FRI) increases. Two intermediate fire regime types (mixed evergreen and bigcone Douglas-fir) showed a similar relationship between fire frequency and fire severity. However, red fir and redwood forests, which are characterized by more climate-limited fire regimes, did not show significant positive relationships between FRI and fire severity. This analysis provides strong evidence that for fuel-limited fire regimes, lack of fire leads to increasing rates of high-severity burning. Our study also substantiates the general validity of ?fuel-limited? vs. ?climate-limited? explanations of differing patterns of fire effects and response in forest types of the western US.},

The volume of stones and boulders was 43.4\%, on average, although it was 47.6\% for the most common soil type on glacial till parent material. The variation was spatially correlated and there were regional patterns, which were related to bedrock composition and Quaternary development. A stoniness function was developed for the upper 30 cm of the mineral soil and this was used to translate the penetration depths into stone and boulder content. The function was based on a reference data set of 200 soil pits. A relationship was found between stone and boulder content and surface boulder frequency, but the strength of the relationship varied regionally. In some regions surface boulders may provide an indicator of stone and boulder content in the soil. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Surveys show most Americans believe climate change poses serious risks but also that reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions sufficient to stabilize atmospheric GHG concentrations can be deferred until there is greater evidence that climate change is harmful. US policymakers likewise argue it is prudent to wait and see whether climate change will cause substantial economic harm before undertaking policies to reduce emissions. Such wait-and-see policies erroneously presume climate change can be reversed quickly should harm become evident, underestimating substantial delays in the climates response to anthropogenic forcing. We report experiments with highly educated adults graduate students at MIT showing widespread misunderstanding of the fundamental stock and flow relationships, including mass balance principles, that lead to long response delays. GHG emissions are now about twice the rate of GHG removal from the atmosphere. GHG concentrations will therefore continue to rise even if emissions fall, stabilizing only when emissions equal removal. In contrast, most subjects believe atmospheric GHG concentrations can be stabilized while emissions into the atmosphere continuously exceed the removal of GHGs from it. These beliefs analogous to arguing a bathtub filled faster than it drains will never overflow support wait-and-see policies but violate conservation of matter. Low public support for mitigation policies may arise from misconceptions of climate dynamics rather than high discount rates or uncertainty about the impact of climate change. Implications for education and communication between scientists and nonscientists (the public and policymakers) are discussed.},

Previous attempts to quantify soil C sequestration capacity have focused primarily on silt and clay protection and largely ignored the effects of soil structural protection and biochemical protection. We assessed two contrasting models of SOC accumulation, one with no saturation limit (i.e., linear first-order model) and one with an explicit soil C saturation limit (i.e., C saturation model). We isolated soil fractions corresponding to the C pools (i.e., free particulate organic matter [POM], microaggregate-associated C, silt- and clay-associated C, and nonhydrolyzable C) from eight long-term agroecosystem experiments across the United States and Canada. Due to the composite nature of the physically protected C pool, we fractioned it into mineral- vs. POM-associated C. Within each site, the number of fractions fitting the C saturation model was directly related to maximum SOC content, suggesting that a broad range in SOC content is necessary to evaluate fraction C saturation. The two sites with the greatest SOC range showed C saturation behavior in the chemically, biochemically, and some mineral-associated fractions of the physically protected pool. The unprotected pool and the aggregate-protected POM showed linear, nonsaturating behavior. Evidence of C saturation of chemically and biochemically protected SOC pools was observed at sites far from their theoretical C saturation level, while saturation of aggregate-protected fractions occurred in soils closer to their C saturation level.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Managed grasslands have the potential to store carbon (C) and partially mitigate climate change. However, it remains difficult to predict potential C storage under a given soil or management practice. To study C storage dynamics due to long-term (1952–2009) phosphorus (P) fertilizer and irrigation treatments in New Zealand grasslands, we measured radiocarbon (               14               C) in archived soil along with observed changes in C stocks to constrain a compartmental soil model. Productivity increases from P application and irrigation in these trials resulted in very similar C accumulation rates between 1959 and 2009. The ∆               14               C changes over the same time period were similar in plots that were both irrigated and fertilized, and only differed in a non-irrigated fertilized plot. Model results indicated that decomposition rates of fast cycling C (0.1 to 0.2~year               −1               ) increased to nearly offset increases in inputs. With increasing P fertilization, decomposition rates also increased in the slow pool (0.005 to 0.008~year               −1               ). Our findings show sustained, significant (i.e. greater than 4 per mille) increases in C stocks regardless of treatment or inputs. As the majority of fresh inputs remain in the soil for less than 10~years, these long term increases reflect dynamics of the slow pool. Additionally, frequent irrigation was associated with reduced stocks and increased decomposition of fresh plant material. Rates of C gain and decay highlight trade-offs between productivity, nutrient availability, and soil C sequestration as a climate change mitigation strategy.},

  abstract = {Plant-derived carbon compounds enter soils in a number of forms; two of the most abundant being leaf litter and rhizodeposition. Our knowledge concerning the predominant controls on the cycling of leaf litter far outweighs that for rhizodeposition even though the constituents of rhizodeposits includes a cocktail of low molecular weight organic compounds which represent a rapidly cycling source of carbon, readily available to soil microbes. We determined the mineralization dynamics of a major rhizodeposit, glucose, and its relationship to land-use, microbial community and edaphic characteristics across a landscape in the southeastern United States. The landscape consists of cultivated, pasture, pine plantation, and hardwood forest sites (n = 3). Mineralization dynamics were resolved in both winter and summer using an in situ13C-glucose pulse-chase approach. Mineralization rates of the labeled glucose decline exponentially across the 72 h measurement periods. This pattern and absolute mineralization rates are consistent across seasons. An information-theoretic approach reveals that land-use is a moderately strong predictor of cumulative glucose mineralization. Measures assessing the size, activity, and/or composition of the microbial community were poor predictors of glucose mineralization. The strongest predictor of glucose mineralization was soil-extractable phosphorus. It was positively related to glucose mineralization across seasons and explained 60\% and 48\% of variation in cumulative glucose mineralization in the summer and winter, respectively. We discuss potential mechanisms underlying the relationship between soil phosphorus and glucose mineralization. Our results suggest that specific soil characteristics often related to land-use and/or land-management decisions may be strong predictors of glucose mineralization rates across a landscape. We emphasize the need for future research into the role of soil phosphorus availability and land-use history in determining soil organic carbon dynamics. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

The value of these yield maps can be com- promised by the fact that raw yield maps contain a variety of inherent errors. Researchers have reported that 10 to 50\% of the observations in a given field contain significant errors and should be removed. Methods for removing these outliers from raw yield data have not been standardized, although many different filtering techniques have been suggested to address specific error types. We developed a soft- ware tool called Yield Editor to simplify the process of applying filtering techniques for yield data outlier detection and removal. Yield Editor includes a map view of the yield data, allowing the user to interactively set, assess the effects of, and refine a number of pre- viously reported automated filtering methods.Additionally, Yield Edi- tor allows manual selection of erroneous points, transects, or regions for investigation and possible deletion. This paper describes the filters implemented in Yield Editor, discusses input, output, and filtering options, and documents availability of the program. Example appli- cations of Yield Editor on five test fields are used to show how the user interacts with the software and to analyze the relative importance of the various filters.},

  abstract = {The eddy covariance (EC) method is routinely used to measure net ecosystem fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) and evapotranspiration (ET) in terrestrial ecosystems. It is often desirable to partition CO2 flux into gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (RE), and to partition ET into evaporation and transpiration. We applied multiple partitioning methods, including the recently-developed flux variance similarity (FVS) partitioning method, to a ten-year record of ET and CO2 fluxes measured using EC at Morgan Monroe State Forest, a temperate, deciduous forest located in south-central Indiana, USA. While the FVS method has previously been demonstrated in croplands and grasslands, this is the first evaluation of the method in a forest. CO2 fluxes were partitioned using nonlinear regressions, FVS, and sub-canopy EC measurements. ET was partitioned using FVS and sub-canopy EC measurements, and sub-canopy potential evapotranspiration was calculated as an additional constraint on forest floor evaporation. Leaf gas exchange measurements were used to parameterize a model of water use efficiency (WUE) necessary for the FVS method. Scaled leaf gas exchange measurements also provided additional independent estimates of GPP and transpiration. There was good agreement among partitioning methods for transpiration and GPP, which also agreed well with scaled leaf gas exchange measurements. There was higher variability among methods for RE and evaporation. The sub-canopy flux method yielded lower estimates of evaporation and RE than FVS and lower estimates of RE than the nonlinear regression method, likely due to the exclusion of flux sources within the canopy but above the top of the sub-canopy tower for the sub-canopy flux method. Based on a sensitivity test, FVS flux partitioning was moderately sensitive to errors in WUE values, and underestimates of WUE significantly reduced the rate at which the algorithm was able to produce a physically valid solution. FVS partitioning has unique potential for retroactive ET partitioning at EC sites, because it relies on the same continuous measurements as EC and does not require additional specialized equipment. FVS also has advantages for partitioning CO2 fluxes, since it does not rely on the mechanistic assumptions necessary for the commonly used nonlinear regression technique.},

Soils contain more carbon than plants or the atmosphere, and sensitivities of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks to changing climate and plant productivity are a major uncertainty in global carbon cycle projections. Despite a consensus that microbial degradation and mineral stabilization processes control SOC cycling, no systematic synthesis of long-term warming and litter addition experiments has been used to test process-based microbe-mineral SOC models. We explored SOC responses to warming and increased carbon inputs using a synthesis of 147 field manipulation experiments and five SOC models with different representations of microbial and mineral processes. Model projections diverged but encompassed a similar range of variability as the experimental results. Experimental measurements were insufficient to eliminate or validate individual model outcomes. While all models projected that CO2 efflux would increase and SOC stocks would decline under warming, nearly one-third of experiments observed decreases in CO2 flux and nearly half of experiments observed increases in SOC stocks under warming. Long-term measurements of C inputs to soil and their changes under warming are needed to reconcile modeled and observed patterns. Measurements separating the responses of mineral-protected and unprotected SOC fractions in manipulation experiments are needed to address key uncertainties in microbial degradation and mineral stabilization mechanisms. Integrating models with experimental design will allow targeting of these uncertainties and help to reconcile divergence among models to produce more confident projections of SOC responses to global changes.},

The distribution of soil carbon (SC) with depth varies among ecosystems and land uses and is an important factor in calculating SC stocks and their vulnerabilities. Systematic analysis of SC depth distributions across databases of SC profiles has been challenging due to the heterogeneity of soil profile measurements, which vary in depth sampling. Here, we fit over 40,000 SC depth profiles to an exponential decline relationship with depth to determine SC concentration at the top of the mineral soil, minimum SC concentration at depth, and the characteristic “length” of SC concentration decline with depth. Fitting these parameters allowed profile characteristics to be analyzed across a large and heterogeneous dataset. We then assessed the differences in these depth parameters across soil orders and land cover types and between soil profiles with or without a history of tillage, as represented by the presence of an Ap horizon. We found that historically tilled soils had more gradual decreases of SC with depth (greater e-folding depth or Z∗), deeper SC profiles, lower SC concentrations at the top of the mineral soil, and lower total SC stocks integrated to 30 cm. The large database of profiles allowed these results to be confirmed across different land cover types and spatial areas within the Continental United States, providing robust evidence for systematic impacts of historical tillage on SC stocks and depth distributions.},

However, these kinds of conductors usually suffer poor tearing property and insufficient compliance to curved surfaces, which greatly limited their applications. Currently no three-dimensionally mountable sensor arrays have been reported. In this work, we developed an excellent mechanically compliant skin-like conductors by patterning silver nano wire traces in Dragon Skin® substrate instead of PDMS substrate, high cross-link quality was achieved then. Moreover, to further enhance the conductivity, a thin gold layer was coated on the AgNWs strips, 4 different fabrication routines was designed and conducted. Thanks to the intrinsically outstanding physical property of Dragon Skin and the uniform embedment built in fabrication process, the AgNWs/Dragon Skin layer showed convincible advantage over AgNWs/PDMS layer both in mechanical capability and conductive stability.},

According to the new view, humic substances are collections of diverse, relatively low molecular mass components forming dynamic associations stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. These associations are capable of organizing into micellar structures in suitable aqueous environments. Humic components display contrasting molecular motional behavior and may be spatially segregated on a scale of nanometers. Within this new structural context, these components comprise any molecules intimately associated with a humic substance, such that they cannot be separated effectively by chemical or physical methods. Thus biomolecules strongly bound within humic fractions are by definition humic components, a conclusion that necessarily calls into question key biogeochemical pathways traditionally thought to be required for the formation of humic substances. Further research is needed to elucidate the intermolecular interactions that link humic components into supramolecular associations and to establish the pathways by which these associations emerge from the degradation of organic litter.},

SOC concentration values are often obtained by prediction but the prediction accuracy depends much on the method used. Currently, there is a lack of evidence in the soil science literature as to the advantages and shortcomings of the different commonly used prediction methods. Therefore, we compared and evaluated the merits of the median approach, analysis of covariance, mixed models and random forests in the context of prediction of SOC concentrations of mineral soils under arable management in the A-horizon. Three soil properties were used in all of the developed models: soil type, physical clay content (particle size {$<$}0.01 mm) and A-horizon thickness. We found that the mixed model predicted SOC concentrations with the smallest mean squared error (0.05\%2), suggesting that a mixed-model approach is appropriate if the study design has a hierarchical structure as in our scenario. We used the Estonian National Soil Monitoring data on arable lands to predict SOC concentrations of mineral soils. Subsequently, the model with the best prediction accuracy was applied to the Estonian digital soil map for the case study area of Tartu County where the SOC predictions ranged from 0.6 to 4.8\%. Our study indicates that predictions using legacy soil maps can be used in national inventories and for up-scaling estimates of carbon concentrations from county to country scales.},

In addition to their role in mitigating climate change, SCS practices play a role in delivering agroecosystem resilience, climate change adapt‐ ability and food security. Environmental heterogeneity and differences in agricultural practices challenge the practical implementation of SCS, and our analysis addresses the associated knowledge gap. Previous assessments have focused on global poten‐ tials, but there is a need among policymakers to operationalise SCS. Here, we assess a range of practices already proposed to deliver SCS, and distil these into a subset of specific measures. We provide a multidisciplinary summary of the barriers and poten‐ tial incentives towards practical implementation of these measures. First, we identify specific practices with potential for both a positive impact on SCS at farm level and an uptake rate compatible with global impact. These focus on: (a) optimising crop pri‐ mary productivity (e.g. nutrient optimisation, pH management, irrigation); (b) reduc‐ ing soil disturbance and managing soil physical properties (e.g. improved rotations, minimum till); (c) minimising deliberate removal of C or lateral transport via erosion processes (e.g. support measures, bare fallow reduction); (d) addition of C produced outside the system (e.g. organic manure amendments, biochar addition); (e) provision of additional C inputs within the cropping system (e.g. agroforestry, cover cropping). We then consider economic and non‐cost barriers and incentives for land managers implementing these measures, along with the potential externalised impacts of im‐ plementation. This offers a framework and reference point for holistic assessment of the impacts of SCS. Finally, we summarise and discuss the ability of extant scientific approaches to quantify the technical potential and externalities of SCS measures, and the barriers and incentives to their implementation in global agricultural systems.},

In this study we sampled soils along a 10-treatment management intensity gradient to a 1-m depth to test the hypothesis that C gains in surface soils are off set by losses lower in the profi le. Treatments included four annual cropping systems in a corn (Zea mays)–soybean (Glycine max)– wheat (Triticum aestivum) rotation, perennial alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and poplar (Populus x euramericana), and four unmanaged successional systems. Th e annual grain systems included conventionally tilled, no-tillage, reduced- input, and organic systems. Unmanaged treatments included a 12-yr-old early successional community, two 50-yr-old mid-successional communities, and a mature forest never cleared for agriculture. All treatments were replicated three to six times and all cropping systems were 12 yr post-establishment when sampled. Surface soil C concentrations and total C pools were signifi cantly greater under no-till, organic, early successional, never-tilled mid-successional, and deciduous forest systems than in the conventionally managed cropping system (p  0.05, n = 3–6 replicate sites). We found no consistent diff erences in soil C at depth, despite intensive sampling (30–60 deep soil cores per treatment). Carbon concentrations in the B/Bt and Bt2/C horizons were lower and two and three times more variable, respectively, than in surface soils. We found no evidence for C gains in the surface soils of no-till and other treatments to be either off set or magnifi ed by carbon change at depth.},

Identifying the effects of alternative bioenergy cropping systems on soil carbon (C) is necessary to assess the sustainability of renewable fuels. We measured the response of soil organic carbon (SOC) pools to four bioenergy cropping systems using soils collected at the establishment of the field trials and after five years in two soils of contrasting texture: a fine-textured silt loam (Mollisol) in south central Wisconsin and a coarse-textured sandy loam (Alfisol) in southwestern Michigan, USA. Crop management followed region-specific practices with no till with the intention of reducing soil C losses from cultivation. Cropping systems included an annual monoculture (continuous corn), two perennial monocultures (switchgrass and hybrid poplar), and a perennial polyculture (restored native prairie). Using a 365-d laboratory soil incubation and a three-pool model, we estimated sizes and turnover times of SOC in surface (0–10 cm) and deeper soils (25–50 cm). After five years, all soils had less bioavailable C as measured by microbial respiration. To determine potential differences in soil C turnover under annual and perennial monocultures, we measured radiocarbon abundance ( 14 C) of bulk soils and respired CO 2 under corn and switchgrass. Respired-CO 2 was more depleted in 14 C over time, indicating preferential respiration of relatively “old C” after five years. Decreased microbial respiration rates after five years of bioenergy cropping systems offer the potential for the eventual reduction of soil C losses after conversion to no till. However, the 14 C-CO 2 data suggest that previously-protected C pools may become depleted over time, especially with continued removal of plant inputs. Results show that conversion of conventional field-crop agriculture to bioenergy cropping systems may not provide belowground C benefits in the short term, as indicated by reductions in the size of the active pool. Reduced total soil respiration over the length of the study, as well as system-specific differences in soil respiration (monoculture annuals {$<$} monoculture perennial {$<$} polyculture perennials), suggest C loss may decline in perennial polyculture systems as they age. SOM pools responded differently to bioenergy crop management on soils with contrasting texture, highlighting the importance of geography in predicting belowground consequences of intensified agricultural production.},

  abstract = {Soil bulk density (Db) is a major contributor to uncertainties in landscape-scale carbon and nutrient stock estimation. However, it is time consuming to measure and is, therefore, frequently predicted using surrogate variables, such as soil texture. Using this approach is of limited value for estimating landscape scale inventories, as its accuracy beyond the sampling point at which texture is measured becomes highly uncertain. In this paper, we explore the ability of soil landscape models to predict soil Db using a suite of landscape attributes and derivatives for both topsoil and subsoil. The models were constructed using random forests and artificial neural networks. Using these statistical methods, we have produced a spatially distributed prediction of Db on a 100m × 100m grid which was shown to significantly improve topsoil carbon stock estimation. In comparison to using mean values from point measurements, the error associated with predictions was over three times lower using the gridded prediction. Within our study area of the Midlands, UK, we found that the gridded prediction of Db produced a stock inventory of nearly 8 million tonnes of carbon less than the mean method. Furthermore, the gridded approach was particularly useful in improving organic carbon (OC) stock estimation for fine-scale landscape units at which many landscape-atmosphere interaction models operate.},

  abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a significant component of the global carbon (C) cycle. Changes in SOC storage affect atmospheric CO2 concentrations on decadal to centennial timescales. The C-TOOL model was developed to simulate farm- and regional-scale effects of management on medium- to long-term SOC storage in the profile of well-drained agricultural mineral soils. C-TOOL uses three SOC pools for both the topsoil (0-25cm) and the subsoil (25-100cm), and applies temperature-dependent first order kinetics to regulate C turnover. C-TOOL also enables the simulation of 14C turnover. The simple model structure facilitates calibration and requires few inputs (mean monthly air temperature, soil clay content, soil C/N ratio and C in organic inputs). The model was parameterised using data from 19 treatments drawn from seven long-term field experiments in the United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark. It was found that the initial SOC content had to be optimised for each experiment, but also that one set of values for other model parameters could be applied at all sites. With this set of parameters, C-TOOL can be applied more widely to evaluate effects of management options on SOC storage in temperate agricultural soils. C-TOOL simulates observed losses of SOC in soils under intensive agricultural use and the gain in SOC derived from large inputs of animal manure and inclusion of perennial grassland. The model simulates changes in SOC for the entire profile, but lack of data on subsoil SOC storage hampers a proper model evaluation. Experimental verification of management effects on subsoil C storage, subsoil C inputs from roots, and vertical transport of C in the soil profile remains prioritised research areas.},

  abstract = {The clay mineralogy and chemistry were determined for five pedons derived from tephra and volcaniclastic materials in northern California. These soils are believed to have formed under vegetation and climatic conditions similar to those at present; coniferous vegetation and a xeric soil moisture regime with approximately 1000 mm of annual precipitation. The five pedons showed a surface enrichment of organic carbon (3.6-6.7\%), an acidic to neutral pH (5.3-6.9), and a generally low base saturation (10-40\%). The high concentrations of free iron oxides (2-10\% Fe) and clay (20-50\%) indicate a relatively high degree of weathering. Clay mineralogy was dominated by imogolite and/or halloysite with lesser amounts of gibbsite and Al-humus complexes. Concentrations of Si in solutions equilibrated with the soils ranged between 10-3.85 and 10-3.45 M. Solubility calculations and data from the literature indicate that imogolite or Al-rich allophane should be preferentially formed at these Si concentrations. However, there was no relationship between the Si concentration and the predominance of imogolite versus halloysite. The coexistence of gibbsite, imogolite, and halloysite may be due to their differential formation as the soil solution Si concentrations fluctuate between the intense winter-spring leaching period and the pronounced summer period of desiccation and/or to the transformation of amorphous products to more crystalline minerals upon desiccation. In addition, the summer desiccation has led to the dehydration of halloysite in the surface horizon while halloysite in the lower horizons remains hydrated. Classification of the pedons according to Soil Taxonomy indicates an Andisol-Inceptisol-Alfisol transition that results from the transformation of active forms of Al and Fe, such as imogolite and ferrihydrite, to more highly crystalline phases. The two pedons dominated by imogolite were classified as Andisols, while the remaining three pedons were dominated by halloysite and did not meet andic soil property criteria because of a deficiency of active Al of active Al and Fe. © 1993.},

These properties are largely due to the dominance of short-range-ordered minerals (allophane, imogolite and ferrihydrite) and/or metal-humus complexes (Al/Fe-humus complexes) in their colloidal fraction. While several papers have extensively reviewed the nature and properties of short-range-ordered minerals, there is no comprehensive review of the genesis, characteristics and management implications of Al-humus complexes, the dominant form of active Al in non-allophanic Andosols. In this review, we survey the chemical characteristics of Al-humus complexes and discuss the pedogenic environment favoring their formation in non-allophanic Andosols. The role of Al-humus complexes in carbon cycling and soil organic carbon accumulation is emphasized as an important mechanism controlling organic dynamics in Andosols. While non-allophanic Andosols share many common properties with allophanic Andosols, they display several distinct characteristics associated with Al-humus complexes, such as strong acidity and high exchangeable Al content that impair agricultural productivity due to Al phytotoxicity. Thus, we focus on the role of Al-humus complexes in regulating aqueous Al3+ solubility and release/retention kinetics, Al phytotoxicity, phosphorus dynamics, and suppression of soil-borne diseases. Knowledge of these soil properties as related to Al-humus complexes is necessary to develop effective soil management practices to assure sustainable agricultural productivity in non-allophanic Andosols. Finally, future research needs are identified concerning the role of Al-humus complexes in regulating soil biogeochemical processes.},

We continuously measured CO2 concentration at various depths in the soil and calculated surface CO2 efflux based on CO 2 gradients and diffusivity in a young ponderosa pine plantation in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. We determined soil respiration both in a control plot that included roots and in a trenched plot that had no roots. The difference between these plots was used to partition soil respiration into root respiration and heterotrophic respiration. We found that both CO 2 concentration in the soil and surface CO2 efflux in the control plot were higher than in the trenched plot. The diurnal range of soil respiration in the trenched plot was larger than in the control. We observed dramatic pulses of soil respiration in response to rain events in summer and fall during the dry season. We modeled the seasonal variation in soil respiration without the pulses using soil temperature and moisture as driving variables and simulated soil respiration pulses using an exponential decay function in response to the volume of rain. Daily mean soil respiration peaked at 5.0 μmol m-2 s-1 in the control and at 2.7 μmol m-2 s-1 in the trenched plot in June before the rain pulses. Soil respiration increased from 4.9 to 8.2 and to 12.1 μmol m -2 s-1 after the first and second rain events in the control, and increased from 2.2 to 4.1 and to 6.6 μmol m-2 s -1 in the trenched plot. After incorporating the pulse effect, the model simulated measured data well. Annual soil respiration in 2003 was estimated as 1184 g C m-2 y-1.

  abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation is strongly affected by soil erosion and deposition that differ at slope positions of a watershed. However, studies on the effects of topography on soil aggregation and SOC dynamics, especially after the implementation of vegetation restoration, are rare. Poorly understood mechanisms and a lack of quantification for the suite of ecological benefits brought by the impacts of topography after planting further obstructed our understanding of terrestrial ecosystem carbon (C) sequestration. The purposes of this study are to (1) quantify the impacts of vegetation restoration on size and stability of soil aggregates and the sequestration of C in soil and (2) to address the impacts of various slope locations on aggregates and SOC distribution. The experimental sites were set up in 1959 on a highly disturbed barren land in a tropical and coastal area of Guangdong province in South China. One site received human-induced vegetation restoration (the restored site), while the other received no planting and has remained as barren land (the barren site). The soil in the study sites was a latosol developed from granite. Soil samples were taken from 0 to 20 and 20 to 40 cm soil layer at shoulder and toe slope positions at both sites for comparisons. Soils were analyzed for proportion of soil macroaggregates ({$>$} 0.25 mm), the SOC in soil layers, and the aggregate soil organic carbon (AOC) at different aggregate sizes. Measurements in 2007 showed that fractions of water stable macroaggregates in 0-40 cm at shoulder and toe slope ranged from 28\% to 45\%, about one third to one half of those of dry macroaggregates (91-95\%) at the restored site. Soil macroaggregates were not detected at barren site in 2007. Average SOC storage in 0-40 cm soil layer of shoulder and toe slope positions at the restored site was 56.5 +/- 10.9 Mg C ha(-1), about 2.4 times of that (23.4 +/- 4.6 Mg C ha(-1)) at barren site in 2007. Since 1959, the soil aggregation and SOC storage are significantly improved at the restored site; opposite to that, soil physical and chemical quality has remained low on the barren land without planting. SOC storage in 0-40 cm at toe slope was 15.9 +/- 1.8 Mg C ha(-1), which is only half of that (30.9 +/- 9 Mg C ha(-1)) at shoulder slope of the barren site; this is opposite to the pattern found at restored site. The ratios of AOC in 0-20 cm to AOC in 20-40 cm at toe slope were lower than those at shoulder slope of the restored site. The comparison of organic carbon sequestered in soils at different slope positions suggest that soil aggregates played a role in sequestering C based upon landscape positions and soil profile depth as a consequence of soil erosion and deposition. Results indicate that vegetation restoration and SOC accumulation significantly enhance soil aggregation, which in turn promotes further organic C accumulation in the aggregates via physical protection. Soil aggregation and soil C accumulation differed between slope positions. Soil aggregation was significantly enhanced in 0-20 cm layer and aggregates absorb C into deep layers in depositional environment (toe slope) under protection from human disturbances. The interactions of erosion-deposition, soil aggregates, and vegetation restoration play important roles on SOC accumulation and redistribution on land. The positive feedback between SOC and soil aggregates should be evaluated for improving the quantification of the impacts of land use change, erosion, and deposition on the dynamics of SOC and soil structure under the global climate change.},

This novel study integrated deep learning, data assimilation, 25,444 vertical soil profiles, and the Community Land Model version 5 (CLM5) to optimize the model representation of SOC over the conterminous United States. We firstly constrained parameters in CLM5 using observations of vertical profiles of SOC in both a batch mode (using all individual soil layers in one batch) and at individual sites (site-by-site). The estimated parameter values from the site-by-site data assimilation were then either randomly sampled (random-sampling) to generate continentally homogeneous (constant) parameter values or maximally preserved for their spatially heterogeneous distributions (varying parameter values to match the spatial patterns from the site-by-site data assimilation) so as to optimize spatial representation of SOC in CLM5 through a deep learning technique (neural networking) over the conterminous United States. Comparing modeled spatial distributions of SOC by CLM5 to observations yielded increasing predictive accuracy from default CLM5 settings (R2 = 0.32) to randomly sampled (0.36), one-batch estimated (0.43), and deep learning optimized (0.62) parameter values. While CLM5 with parameter values derived from random-sampling and one-batch methods substantially corrected the overestimated SOC storage by that with default model parameters, there were still considerable geographical biases. CLM5 with the spatially heterogeneous parameter values optimized from the neural networking method had the least estimation error and less geographical biases across the conterminous United States. Our study indicated that deep learning in combination with data assimilation can significantly improve the representation of SOC by complex land biogeochemical models.},

In case of the band at 2506 cm−1 the difference between FT-IR and Scheibler method was a factor of 1.56, in case of 875 cm−1 the respective factor was 1.16. It can be concluded that FT-IR with both bands has a potential to be used in practice as substitution of the Scheibler method. The advantages of the FT-IR method are better reproducibility and the simultaneous characterization of soil organic matter in bulk samples. The disadvantage is its higher cost.},

  abstract = {Analyses of organic and inorganic carbon are of great interest in the field of soil analyses. Soil samples from a national monitoring project were provided for this study, including more than 130 forest sites from Austria. We investigated the humus layers (if present undecomposed litter (L), of mixed samples of F- (intermediate decomposed organic matter) and H-(highly decomposed organic matter) (FH)) and upper mineral soil layers (0-5 and 5-10 cm) of the samples. Mid-infrared spectra were recorded and evaluated by their band areas; subsequently we calculated models with the partial least squares approach. This was done by correlating calculated data of the mid-infrared spectra with gas-volumetrically determined carbonate values and measurements of organic carbon from an elemental analyzer. For carbonate determination, this approach gave satisfying results. For measurements of organic carbon, it was necessary to discriminate into humus layers and mineral soils or even more groups to obtain satisfactory correlations between spectroscopically determined and conventionally measured values. These additional factors were the presence of carbonate, the forest type, and the dominant tree species. In mineral soils, fewer subdivisions were necessary to obtain useful results. In humus layers, groupings of sites with more similar characteristics had to be formed in order to obtain satisfying results. The conclusion is that the chemical background of soil organic matter leading to different proportions of functional groups, especially in the less humified organic matter of the humus layers, plays a key role in analyses with mid-infrared spectroscopy. Keeping this in mind, the present approach has a significant potential for the prediction of properties of forest soil layers, such as, e.g., carbonate and organic carbon contents.},

  abstract = {High carbon uptake of old-growth forests contradict the assumption that old-growth forests are carbon neutral and suggest their Kyoto relevance. As tree biomass is unlikely to store additional carbon in the long term we investigated carbon and nitrogen stock changes in the soil. Therefore we performed paired soil sampling in the years 2000 and 2004 at the National Park Hainich, Germany. In the upper 0-20cm soil layer 498gSOCm -2 was lost in 4years, but interestingly in 20-60cm soil depth 1155gm -2 of SOC was stored, resulting in an accumulation rate of 164gm -2 per year. In the same time nitrogen was accumulated at a rate of 32gNm -2 per year. While in 0-20cm preferential carbon was respired, in the deeper soil layers organic matter with a C/N ratio of microbial organisms was gained. Most interestingly 14C measurements indicate that gained and lost carbon is of recent carbon age.Our findings suggest that soil organic matter even in deeper soil horizons is very dynamic and that possibly root driven carbon input can significantly change soil organic matter stocks in all depth segments simultaneously. In consequence old growth forests still have a high soil organic matter storage potential as their roots sustain a long-lived permanent storage structure. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Stable and radiocarbon isotopes were used to investigate the role of soil clay content in the storage and dynamics of soil carbon in tropical forest soils. Organic matter in clay-rich Oxisols and Ultisols contains at least two distinct components: (1) material with light \&\#948;13C signatures and turnover times of decades or less; and (2) clay-associated, 13C-enriched, carbon with turnover times of decades at the surface to millennia at depths {$>$}20 cm. Soil texture, in this case clay content, exerts a major control on the amount of slowly cycling carbon and therefore influences the storage and dynamics of carbon in tropical forest soils. Soils in primary tropical forest have been proposed as a potentially large sink for anthropogenic carbon. Comparison of carbon stocks in Oxisols sampled near Manaus, Brazil, shows no measurable change in organic carbon stocks over the past 20 years. Simple models estimating the response of soil carbon pools to a sustained 0.5\% yr\&\#8722;1 increase in productivity result in C storage rates of 0.09 to 0.13 MgC ha\&\#8722;1 yr\&\#8722;1 in soil organic matter, with additional potential storage of 0.18 to 0.27 MgC ha\&\#8722;1 yr\&\#8722;1 in surface litter and roots. Most storage occurs in organic matter pools with turnover times less than a decade. Export of carbon in dissolved form from upland terra firme Oxisols likely accounts for {$<$}0.2 MgC ha\&\#8722;1 yr\&\#8722;1, but more work is required to assess the export potential for periodically inundated Spodosols.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystems remove about 30 per cent of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted by human activities each year1, yet the persistence of this carbon sink depends partly on how plant biomass and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks respond to future increases in atmospheric CO2 (refs. 2,3). Although plant biomass often increases in elevated CO2 (eCO2) experiments4–6, SOC has been observed to increase, remain unchanged or even decline7. The mechanisms that drive this variation across experiments remain poorly understood, creating uncertainty in climate projections8,9. Here we synthesized data from 108 eCO2 experiments and found that the effect of eCO2 on SOC stocks is best explained by a negative relationship with plant biomass: when plant biomass is strongly stimulated by eCO2, SOC storage declines; conversely, when biomass is weakly stimulated, SOC storage increases. This trade-off appears to be related to plant nutrient acquisition, in which plants increase their biomass by mining the soil for nutrients, which decreases SOC storage. We found that, overall, SOC stocks increase with eCO2 in grasslands (8 ± 2 per cent) but not in forests (0 ± 2 per cent), even though plant biomass in grasslands increase less (9 ± 3 per cent) than in forests (23 ± 2 per cent). Ecosystem models do not reproduce this trade-off, which implies that projections of SOC may need to be revised.},

In the case of stony soils, the volume percentage of the content of rock fragments remains difficult to estimate in situ. This paper presents a method that uses field spatial electrical resistivity measurements to determine the volume proportion of rock fragments. Based on the hypothesis that the electrical resistivity signal noise increases as the proportion of rock fragments increases, a model was developed that uses the standard deviation of the apparent electrical resistivity measurements over a small area as an indicator of rock fragment contents. The model was tested on three study areas of several hectares containing soil units with varying quantities of rock fragments. The estimation of the rock fragment content was accurate, and the error estimation of about 6\% was the same order of magnitude as the Bussian model (1983). The developed model strongly depends on the water content in the soil and the rock type and must be calibrated in each context. Nevertheless, estimations of the rock fragment content in stony soils can be performed efficiently in the surface horizon as well as all along the soil profile. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Iron compounds in soil are multifunctional, providing physical structure, ion sorption sites, catalytic reaction-centers, and a sink for respiratory electrons. Basaltic soils contain large quantities of iron that reside in different mineral and organic phases depending on their age and redox status. We investigated changes in soil iron concentration and its solid-phase speciation across a single-aged (400ky) lava flow subjected to a gradient in precipitation (2200-4200mmyr -1 ) and hence redox history. With increasing rainfall and decreasing Eh, total Fe decreased from about 25\% to {$<$}1\% of the soil mass. Quantitative speciation of soil solid-phase iron was constrained by combining 57 Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy (MBS) at 295 and 4.2K with powder X-ray diffraction, selective chemical extractions, and magnetic susceptibility measurements. This approach allowed us to partition iron into (1) nanoparticulate and microcrystalline Fe III -(oxy)hydroxides, (2) microcrystalline and bulk Fe III -oxides, (3) organic/silicate bound Fe III , and (4) ferrous iron. The Fe III -(oxy)hydroxide fraction dominated solid-phase Fe, exhibiting a crystallinity continuum based on magnetic ordering temperature. The continuum extended from well-ordered microcrystalline goethite through nanocrystalline Fe III -(oxy)hydroxides to a nano Fe III -(oxy)hydroxide phase of extremely low crystallinity. Magnetic susceptibility was correlated (R 2 =0.77) with Fe III -oxide concentration, consistent with a contribution of maghemite to the otherwise hematite dominated Fe-oxide fraction. The Fe III -(oxy)hydroxide fraction of total Fe decreased with increasing rainfall and was replaced by corresponding increase in the organic/silicate Fe III fraction. The crystallinity of the Fe III -(oxy)hydroxides also decreased with increasing rainfall and leaching, with the most disordered members of the crystallinity continuum, the nano Fe III -(oxy)hydroxides, gaining proportional abundance in the wetter sites. This finding runs counter to the conventional kinetic expectation of preferential removal of the most disordered minerals in a reductive dissolution-dominated environment. We suggest the persistence of highly disordered Fe phases reflects the dynamic redox conditions of these upland soils in which periods of anoxia are marked by high water-throughput and Fe 2+ (aq) removal, while periodic Fe oxidation events occur in the presence of high concentrations of organic matter. Our 57 Fe Mössbauer study shows basalt-derived nano-scale Fe III phases are more disordered than current synthetic analogs and have nano-structural characteristics that are linked to their formation environment. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Frequently, soils are also homogenised following drying and are then rewetted, yet little research has been done to understand how these methods impact upon microbial communities. Here we compared the molecular diversity and functional responses of intact cores from a Scottish grassland soil with homogenised samples prepared by drying, sieving and rewetting or freshly sieving wet soils. Results showed that there was no significant difference in total soil CO2–Cefflux between the freshly sieved and intact core treatments, however, respiration was significantly higher in the dried and rewetted microcosms. Molecular fingerprinting (T-RFLP) of bacterial communities at two different time-points showed that both homogenisation methods significantly altered bacterial community structure with the largest differences being observed after drying and rewetting. Assessments of responsive taxa in each treatment showed that intact cores were dominated by Acidobacterial peaks whereas an increased relative abundance of Alphaproteobacterial terminal restriction fragments were apparent in both homogenised treatments. However, the shift in community structure was not as large in the freshly sieved soil. Our findings suggest that if soil homogenisation must be performed, then fresh sieving of wet soil is preferable to drying and rewetting in approximating the bacterial diversity and functioning of intact cores.},

  abstract = {The land use and climate of Scotland are currently undergoing change. Concentrations of Natural abundance stable isotopes in ecosystems have been used extensively to help to understand a wide range of processes and functions. In the current study topsoil was collected from the intercepts of a 20-km grid across the whole of Scotland (183 points), which encompass large differences in mean annual temperature (MAT,3.1–9.1°C), mean annual precipitation (MAP, 588–3470 mm) and land use (from arable land through grassland and woodland to less fertile moorlands and bogs). At each sampling point the natural abundance δ13C and δ15N values were measured. This paper describes for the first time the spatial distribution of these isotopes in the topsoil of Scotland. We applied linear modelling to assess the extent to which land use and climate can control the observed distributions. The more enriched topsoil δ13C values occurred in the northern and western regions of Scotland. Topsoil δ13C values were tightly constrained about the mean, and possibly because of this we were able to explain only 23.6\% of the variance even after considering the potential effects of a wide range of abiotic factors and land uses. Precipitation and land use explained the greatest variance in topsoil δ13C, but individually this was only 10.4 and 9.9\%, respectively. Topsoil δ15N values showed a more complex spatial arrangement. The main areas of the more enriched δ15N values were in the northern isles, along or near the coast on the eastern side of the country and in some areas of the western mainland. For topsoil δ15N, all explanatory variables together explained 55.7\% of the variance, with land use alone explaining 45.4\%. Soil under arable land and improved grassland, the more fertile sites, had the most enriched δ15N values, whereas woodland and bogs had the most depleted values. A positive relationship between topsoil δ15N and potential rate of nitrification suggested that this was due, at least in part, to greater losses of nitrate under arable land and improved grassland.},

  abstract = {Decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) protected within aggregates can be accelerated via priming effect (PE) by the addition of fresh substrates. However, the knowledge of the sources of mineralization and PE in aggregate size classes is absent. We applied the three-source-partitioning isotopic (14C + δ13C) approach to determine how aggregate size classes affect the contribution of three C sources (substrate added, recent and old SOM) to CO2efflux and PE depending on the amount of added primer. Soil from a field with 3 years of maize cropping (C4plants) after long-term C3vegetation was used to differentiate between recent C (C4C; {$<$} 3 years) and old C (C3C; {$>$}3 years). Soil samples were separated into three aggregate size classes ({$>$}2 mm, 2-0.25 mm macroaggregates and {$<$}0.25 mm microaggregates) and were incubated for 49 days after being amended with two levels of14C labeled glucose.The proportion of glucose mineralized to CO2increased with decreasing aggregate size, but14C incorporation into microbial biomass decreased, indicating higher C use efficiency in macroaggregates compared with microaggregates. The short-time PE was positive and was accompanied by a rapid reduction of dissolved organic C. After 49 days, the PE was higher in macro-versus microaggregates at both glucose levels. Positive PE induced by a low glucose level was observed only in large macroaggregates ({$>$}2 mm), but was observed in both macroaggregates ({$>$}0.25 mm) and microaggregates ({$<$}0.25 mm) after high glucose amendment. These results indicate that SOM pools are more decomposable in macro-versus microaggregates and that the SOM pools are involved in PE according to their biochemical availability. More primed CO2originated from recent C4C than old C3C in larger macroaggregates under a low glucose level. The relative contribution of recent C4C to primed CO2increased from macroaggregates (37.8\%) to microaggregates (100\%) after high glucose amendment. Therefore, increasing glucose addition stimulated the decomposition of old C3C in macroaggregates, but not in microaggregates. This indicates that microaggregates protect SOM against decomposition better than macroaggregates, and consequently, microaggregates can be considered as a potential reservoir for long-term C sequestration.Concluding, aggregate size is crucial for SOM decomposition, and it determines the source of PE and thus the protection of sequestrated C. The effects of the added primer on C sources involved in PE depend on the aggregate size.},

The recently developed radiocarbon method estimates the mean age of organic matter by comparing its radio- carbon content to recorded atmospheric radiocarbon levels, which peaked in the 1960s as a result of thermonuclear weapons testing. The radiocarbon content of fine roots harvested from minirhizotron tubes did not differ from that of roots collected from the soil, suggesting these two methods sampled the same population of fine roots. However, long- term observation of fine root survivorship using minirhizotrons showed that root age distribution is positively skewed, causing systematic overestimation of fine root turnover by the minirhizotron method and underestimation by the radio- carbon method. We developed a parametric regression model of fine root survivorship. Our estimate of fine root turn- over (about 30\% per year) using this variation of the minirhizotron method was supported by radiocarbon data considered in conjunction with fine root age distribution.},

The soil C pool of 8,300 g m-2 is due mainly to humic acid and older humin. If steady state is assumed, and a single soil C pool, the average 14C content of the whole soil (93\% modern) yields a mean carbon residence time of 800 years, although this varied from 300 to 1,600 years in the four samples studied. Stream water fluxes of dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC, POC) were 2.5 and 0.4 g m−2 a−1 respectively in 2002–2003, lower than values for some other upland streams in the UK. The C pool, flux, and isotope data were used, with the assumption of steady state, to calibrate DyDOC, a model that simulates the soil carbon cycle, including the generation and transport of DOC. According to DyDOC, the litter pool (ca. 100 gC m−2) turns over quickly, and most ({$>$}90\%) of the litter carbon is rapidly mineralised. The soil is calculated to gain only 16 gC m−2 a−1, and to lose the same amount, about 80\% as CO2 and 20\% as DOC. From the DO14C content of 107.5\% modern (due to “bomb carbon”) the model could be calibrated by assuming all DOC to come directly from litter, but DOC is more likely a mixture, derived from more than one soil C pool. The seasonal variability exhibited by stream water DOC concentration (maximum in September, minimum in January) is attributed mainly to variations in rainfall and evapotranspiration, rather than in the metabolic production rate of “potential DOC”. The model predicts that, for a Q 10 of 2, the total soil organic C pool would decrease by about 5\% if subjected to warming over 200 years. DyDOC predicts higher DOC fluxes in response to increased litter inputs or warming, and can simulate changes in DOC flux due to variations in sorption to soil solids, that might occur due to acidification and its reversal.},

  abstract = {Good soil structure for crop growth depends on the presence of aggregates of soil particles 1 to 10mm diameter which remain stable when wetted. When an unstable air dried aggregate is wetted rapidly it slakes into smaller sub-units which may also be aggregates. Slaking is common and occurs in a wide range of soils where the aggregates are not strong enough to withstand the pressures of entrapped air in capillaries or the pressures due to the swelling. In the field, slaking of aggregates occurs mainly in surface layers since those below the surface are protected from air-drying and from rapid wetting. Severe slaking with little layers limit infiltration of water and emergence of seedlings. Blackwell scientific publications Aggregate Stability What it is: Soil aggregates are groups of soil particles that bind to each other more strongly than to adjacent particles. Aggregate stability refers to the ability of soil aggregates to resist disintegration when disruptive forces associated with tillage and water or wind erosion are applied. Wet aggregate stability suggests how well a soil can resist raindrop impact and water erosion, while size distribution of dry aggregates can be used to predict resistance to abrasion and wind erosion. Why it is important: Changes in aggregate stability may serve as early indicators of recovery or degradation of soils. Aggregate stability is an indicator of organic matter content, biological activity, and nutrient cycling in soil. Generally, the particles in small aggregates ({$<$} 0.25 mm) are bound by older and more stable forms of organic matter. Microbial decomposition of fresh organic matter releases products (that are less stable) that bind small aggregates into large aggregates ({$>$} 2-5 mm). These large aggregates are more sensitive to management effects on organic matter, serving as a better indicator of changes in soil quality. Greater amounts of stable aggregates suggest better soil quality. When the proportion of large to small aggregates increases, soil quality generally increases. Stable aggregates can also provide a large range in pore space, including small pores within and large pores between aggregates. Pore space is essential for air and water entry into soil, and for air, water, nutrient, and biota movement within soil. Large pores associated with large, stable aggregates favor high infiltration rates and appropriate aeration for plant growth. Pore space also provides zones of weakness for root growth and penetration. Surface crusts and filled pores occur in weakly aggregated soils. Surface crusts prevent infiltration and promote erosion; filled pores lower water-holding and air-exchange capacity and increase bulk density, diminishing the conditions for root growth. Specific problems that might be caused by poor function: Aggregate stability is critical for infiltration, root growth, and resistance to water and wind erosion. Unstable aggregates disintegrate during rainstorms. Dispersed soil particles fill surface pores and a hard physical crust can develop when},

  abstract = {Aggregation and dispersion of mineral particles spontaneously take place under changing environmental conditions in natural systems. The structure of particle network in soils, the retardation or release of colloidal particles, and their mobility and transport are inherently influenced by natural organic matter bound to the mineral matrix. Since the surface properties of clay mineral and metal oxide particles, and the electrified mineral-water interfaces play a major role in formation, structure and strength of aggregates, any surface modification, especially by polyanionic organic complexants such as humic substances, has a significant affect on particle interaction in a mineral assemblage. The permanently and/or conditionally charged clay minerals (montmorillonite and kaolinite) and iron oxides (hematite and magnetite), as known major mineral components in natural waters, were selected for studying their surface charge characteristics and pH dependent interactions. We discuss how the surface charge correlates with particle aggregation through some characteristic examples for homo and heterocoagulation of similar and dissimilar mineral particles under acidic condition (at pH ∼4) in the dilute and concentrated systems studied by means of light scattering and rheology, respectively. The adsorption of a brown coal derived humic acid, and its influence on the surface charge character and particle aggregation of clay and iron oxide particles were also studied in dilute and concentrated suspensions. Humic acids can be bound to the most reactive surface sites of clay and oxide particles, i.e. to Al-OH mainly at the edges of clay lamellae, and to Fe-OH on iron oxides, in surface complexation reaction, therefore their role in particle aggregation is specific. Relations between surface complexation, surface charge modification, and particle aggregation in pure and mixed montmorillonite-iron oxide systems are explained. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Volcanic ash soils contain very large stocks of soil organic matter (SOM) per unit area. Consequently, they constitute potential sources or sinks for the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. Whether soils become a net carbon source or sink with climate and/or land-use change depends on the stability of SOM against decomposition, which is influenced by stabilization mechanisms in the soil. To quantify organic carbon stocks and to clarify the importance of chemical and physical soil characteristics for carbon stabilization in volcanic ash soils, we applied selective extraction techniques, performed X-ray diffraction analysis of the clay fraction and estimated pore-size distribution of soils under natural upper montane forest and grassland (páramo) in the Ecuadorian Andes. Our results show that organic carbon stocks under both vegetation types are roughly twice as large as previously reported global averages for volcanic ash soils. SOM stabilization is suggested to be dominantly influenced by the following chemical and physical soil characteristics: (i) direct stabilization of SOM in organo-metallic (Al-humus) complexes, explaining at most 40\% of carbon accumulation, (ii) indirect protection of SOM (notably aliphatic compounds) through low soil pH and toxic levels of Al, and probably also (iii) physical protection of SOM caused by a very large micro-porosity. Moreover, in the case of the forest soils, inherent recalcitrance of OM itself was responsible for substantial accumulation in ectorganic horizons. Both vegetation types contributed to soil acidification, thus increasing SOM accumulation. © 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2010 British Society of Soil Science.},

  abstract = {A large source of uncertainty in present understanding of the global carbon cycle is the distribution and dynamics of the soil organic carbon reservoir. Most of the organic carbon in soils is degraded to inorganic forms slowly, on timescales from centuries to millennia1 . Soil minerals are known to play a stabilizing role, but how spatial and temporal variation in soil mineralogy con- trols the quantity and turnover of long-residence-time organic carbon is not well known2 . Here we use radiocarbon analyses to explore interactions between soil mineralogy and soil organic carbon along two natural gradients—of soil-age and of climate— in volcanic soil environments. During the first?150,000 years of soil development, the volcanic parent material weathered to metastable, non-crystalline minerals. Thereafter, the amount of 100 non-crystalline minerals declined, and more stable crystalline minerals accumulated. Soil organic carbon content followed a similar trend, accumulating to a maximum after 150,000 years, and then decreasing by 50\% over the next four million years. A positive relationship between non-crystalline minerals and organic carbon was also observed in soils through the climate gradient, indicating that the accumulation and subsequent loss of organic matter were largely driven by changes in the millennial scale cycling of mineral-stabilized carbon, rather than by changes in the amount of fast-cycling organic matter or in net primary productivity. Soil mineralogy is therefore important in determin- ing the quantity of organic carbon stored in soil, its turnover time, and atmosphere–ecosystem carbon fluxes during long-term soil development; this conclusion should be generalizable at least to other humid environments.},

To estimate turnover times and pool sizes of organic matter, we used two independent methods: (1) long-term incubations and (2) a three-box soil model constrained by radiocarbon measurements. Turnover times of slow-pool SOM (the intermediate pool between active and passive pools) calculated from incubations ranged from 6 to 20 y in the 0 horizon and were roughly half as fast in the A horizon. The radiocarbon-based model yielded a similar pattern but slower turnover times. The calculation of the C-14 turnover times is sensitive to the lag time between photosynthesis and incorporation of organic C into SOM in a given horizon. By either method, turnover times at the different sites varied two- or threefold in soils with the same climate and vegetation community. Turnover times were fastest at the sites of highest soil fertility and were correlated with litter decay rates and primary productivity. However, experimental fertilization at the two least-fertile sites had only a small and inconsistent effect on turnover, with N slowing turnover and P slightly speeding it at one site. These results support studies of litter decomposition in suggesting that while plant productivity can respond rapidly to nutrient additions, decomposition may respond much more slowly to added nutrients.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract = {© 2017 The Authors. J. Plant Nutr. Soil Sci. is published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim All soils harbor microaggregates, i.e., compound soil structures smaller than 250 µm. These microaggregates are composed of diverse mineral, organic and biotic materials that are bound together during pedogenesis by various physical, chemical and biological processes. Consequently, microaggregates can withstand strong mechanical and physicochemical stresses and survive slaking in water, allowing them to persist in soils for several decades. Together with the physiochemical heterogeneity of their surfaces, the three-dimensional structure of microaggregates provides a large variety of ecological niches that contribute to the vast biological diversity found in soils. As reported for larger aggregate units, microaggregates are composed of smaller building units that become more complex with increasing size. In this context, organo-mineral associations can be considered structural units of soil aggregates and as nanoparticulate fractions of the microaggregates themselves. The mineral phases considered to be the most important as microaggregate forming materials are the clay minerals and Fe- and Al-(hydr)oxides. Within microaggregates, minerals are bound together primarily by physicochemical and chemical interactions involving cementing and gluing agents. The former comprise, among others, carbonates and the short-range ordered phases of Fe, Mn, and Al. The latter comprise organic materials of diverse origin and probably involve macromolecules and macromolecular mixtures. Work on microaggregate structure and development has largely focused on organic matter stability and turnover. However, little is known concerning the role microaggregates play in the fate of elements like Si, Fe, Al, P, and S. More recently, the role of microaggregates in the formation of microhabitats and the biogeography and diversity of microbial communities has been investigated. Little is known regarding how microaggregates and their properties change in time, which strongly limits our understanding of micro-scale soil structure dynamics. Similarly, only limited information is available on the mechanical stability of microaggregates, while essentially nothing is known about the flow and transport of fluids and solutes within the micro- and nanoporous microaggregate systems. Any quantitative approaches being developed for the modeling of formation, structure and properties of microaggregates are, therefore, in their infancy. We respond to the growing awareness of the importance of microaggregates for the structure, properties and functions of soils by reviewing what is currently known about the formation, composition and turnover of microaggregates. We aim to provide a better understanding of their role in soil function, and to present the major unknowns in current microaggregate research. We propose a harmonized concept for aggregates in soils that explicitly considers the structure and build-up of microaggregates and the role of organo-mineral associations. We call for experiments, studies and modeling endeavors that will link information on aggregate forming materials with their functional properties across a range of scales in order to better understand microaggregate formation and turnover. Finally, we hope to inspire a novel cohort of soil scientists that they might focus their research on improving our understanding of the role of microaggregates within the system of aggregates and so help to develop a unified and quantitative concept of aggregation processes in soils.},

CO2 fluxes early in the incubations decreased rapidly, and then stabilized at approximately 20\% of initial values for seven months. We suggest that the rapid drop and subsequent stabilization of respiration reflects a change in the dominant source of the CO2 from labile (active) to much more recalcitrant pools of soil organic matter (SOM). Estimates of active SOM were made by integrating all of the carbon respired in excess of that attributable to respiration of the intermediate SOM pool; these values ranged from 0.7-4.3\% of total soil C. δ13C values for carbon respired from the pasture soils showed that older, forest-derived C contributed an increasing fraction of total soil respiration with time. Initial and late-stage respiration responded similarly to changes in temperature, suggesting that intermediate SOM is as sensitive to temperature as the active fraction.},

In this study, we performed a cross-validation experiment for predicting carbon dioxide, latent heat, sensible heat and net radiation fluxes across different ecosystem types with 11 machine learning (ML) methods from four different classes (kernel methods, neural networks, tree methods, and regression splines). We applied two complementary setups: (1) 8-day average fluxes based on remotely sensed data and (2) daily mean fluxes based on meteorological data and a mean seasonal cycle of remotely sensed variables. The patterns of predictions from different ML and experimental setups were highly consistent. There were systematic differences in performance among the fluxes, with the following ascending order: net ecosystem exchange (R2 {$<$} 0.5), ecosystem respiration (R2 {$>$} 0.6), gross primary production (R2 {$>$} 0.7), latent heat (R2 {$>$} 0.7), sensible heat (R2 {$>$} 0.7), and net radiation (R2 {$>$} 0.8). The ML methods predicted the across-site variability and the mean seasonal cycle of the observed fluxes very well (R2 {$>$} 0.7), while the 8-day deviations from the mean seasonal cycle were not well predicted (R2 {$<$} 0.5). Fluxes were better predicted at forested and temperate climate sites than at sites in extreme climates or less represented by training data (e.g., the tropics).

In this study, detailed cytogenetic measurements were carried out on six Romanian ecotypes belonging to Hippophae rhamnoides L. ssp. carpatica Rousi, in order to establish the features and the symmetry degree of karyotypes, to evidence the sex chromosomes, and to construct the idiogram. The ecotypes have 2n = 24 metacentric and submetacentric chromosomes. An intraspecific variation exists concerning the proportion of these two morpho-types. The karyotypes have similar symmetry patterns (R = 2.57-2.89; TF\% = 38.54-42.70; AsI\% = 57.99-61.41; A(1) = 0.27-0.35; A(2) = 0.26-0.36) and belong to 1B and 2B classes, being relatively high symmetric. Based on obtained results, we presume that the male sex chromosomes are heteromorphic, while in female plants are homomorphic. The Y chromosome is larger than X chromosome.},

We therefore tested if mineral-associated N is an important N source for soil microorganisms, and which soil parameters control its bioavailability. Microcosm experiments with mineral-associated organic matter, obtained as heavy fraction (HF) via density fractionation, and bulk soil from mineral topsoil of the Franz Josef chronosequence were conducted for 125 days. We examined the effects of O2 status, soil age (differences in mineralogical properties), as well as cellulose and phosphate additions on the turnover of mineral-associated N. Using a combination of activity measurements and quantitative PCR, microbial N transformation rates and abundances of N-related functional genes (amoA, narG, chiA) were determined. Similar or higher values for microbial N cycling rates and N-related functional abundances in the HF compared to bulk soil indicated that mineral-associated N provides an important bioavailable N source for soil microorganism. The turnover of mineral-associated N was mainly controlled by the O2 status. Besides, soil mineralogical properties significantly affected microbial N cycling and related gene abundances with the effect depending on the N substrate type (ON, NH4, or NO3). In contrast, cellulose or phosphate addition hardly enhanced microbial utilization of mineral- associated N. The results of our microcosm study indicate that mineral-associated N is highly bioavailable in mineral topsoils, but effects of the mineral phase differ between N cycling processes.},

Here, we discuss the ecological relevance of bacterial weathering, mainly in the soil and especially in acidic forest ecosystems, which strongly depend on mineral weathering for their sustainability. We also present highlights from recent studies showing molecular mechanisms and genetic determinants involved in the dissolution of complex minerals under aerobic conditions.

We examined patterns of fine root production, aboveground litterfall, and forest floor accumulation during forest primary succession at the Mt. Shasta Mudflows ecosystem chronosequence. Fine root production was measured using the root ingrowth cores method over 1 year, and aboveground litterfall was collected over 2 years. Fine root production increased significantly with ecosystem age, but only the youngest ecosystem was significantly different from all of the older ecosystems. Root production was 44.5 ± 13.3, 168.3 ± 20.6, 190.5 ± 33.8, and 236.3 ± 65.4 g m -2 y -1 in the 77, 255, 616, and {$>$}850-year-old ecosystems, respectively. Generally, aboveground litterfall and forest floor accumulation did not follow the same pattern as root production. The relative contribution of fine root production to total fine detrital production increased significantly with ecosystem age, from 14 to 49\%, but only the youngest ecosystem was significantly different from all of the older ecosystems. Fine root production was significantly correlated with some measures of soil fertility but was not correlated with leaf or total litterfall, or forest floor accumulation. It was best predicted by soil N concentration alone, but this relationship may not be causal, as soil N concentration was also correlated with ecosystem age. For the oldest ecosystem, fine root production was also measured using the sequential intact cores/compartment-flow model method, and the difference between the two estimates was not significant. Our study suggests that the relative contribution of fine roots to fine detrital production, and hence to soil organic matter accumulation, may increase during forest primary succession. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Quantitative soil pits provide direct measurements of total soil mass and elemental content in depth-based samples representative of large volumes, bypassing potential errors associated with independently measuring soil bulk density, rock volume, and elemental concentrations. The method also allows relatively unbiased sampling of other belowground C and nutrient stocks, including roots, coarse organic fragments, and rocks. We present a comprehensive methodology for sampling these pools with quantitative pits and assess their accuracy, precision, effort, and sampling intensity as compared to other methods. At 14 forested sites in New Hampshire, non-soil belowground pools (which other methods may omit, double-count, or undercount) accounted for upward of 25\% of total belowground C and N stocks: coarse material accounted for 4 and 1\% of C and N in the 0 horizon; roots were 11 and 4\% of C and N in the 0 horizon and 10 and 3\% of C and N in the B horizon; and soil adhering to rocks represented 5\% of total B-horizon C and N. The top 50 cm of the C horizon contained the equivalent of 17\% of B-horizon carbon and N. Sampling procedures should be carefully designed to avoid treating these important pools inconsistently. Quantitative soil pits have fewer sources of systematic error than coring methods; the main disadvantage is that because they are time-consuming and create a larger zone of disturbance, fewer observations can be made than with cores.},

  abstract = {The intensification of agricultural production strongly affects the characteristics of traditional rural landscapes. Yet, the complexity of these landscapes also puts constraints on intensification. This interrelationship leads to the hypothesis that the degree of intensification and locality are interdependent. Feedbacks between landscape and intensification often go unnoticed, while such a coupling would argue for spatial explicit studies with a co-evolutionary perspective. In this study, we localized and quantified interactions between landscape patterns and agricultural intensification for dairy farming systems in a traditional Dutch rural landscape. First, a conceptual diagram was made that maps causal interactions between landscape patterns and production intensity. This conceptual diagram was converted to spatial explicit descriptors of landscape patterns, such as hedge density, field size, clay content, ground water hydrology and spatial explicit descriptors of management such as hedgerow change, field aggregation, field grazing days and fertilizer application. Next, these landscape patterns and management descriptors were linked to the current production intensity of farms such as total farm milk yield, milk yield per cow and milk yield per hectare. These descriptors were tested for interrelations by applying two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. We found that a higher milk production was significantly linked to larger fields, fewer hedgerows, fewer grazing days, higher use of N-fertilizer and a decrease of nutrient cycling. Furthermore, production intensity was found to differ with the landscape pattern of clay content and groundwater hydrology. On top of this landscape template, man-made patterns of field sizes and hedgerows from before 1930 are still visible in the current differences of milk production intensity. Current farm management was found to have relations with the hedgerows, field size, clay content and groundwater hydrology. These relations hint at a co-evolution of landscape pattern and agricultural intensification. Interestingly, the largest differences between descriptors of landscape pattern and intensity were found for similar values of clay content, groundwater hydrology and fertilizer use. We speculate that these similar values indicate the existence of tipping points for diverging trajectories of intensification. Identification of such tipping points has implications for policies that deal with the future dynamics of rural landscapes. ?? 2013.},

  abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) forms the largest ter-restrial pool of carbon outside of sedimentary rocks. Radio-carbon is a powerful tool for assessing soil organic matter dy-namics. However, due to the nature of the measurement, ex-tensive 14 C studies of soil systems remain relatively rare. In particular, information on the extent of spatial and temporal variability in 14 C contents of soils is limited, yet this informa-tion is crucial for establishing the range of baseline properties and for detecting potential modifications to the SOM pool. This study describes a comprehensive approach to explore heterogeneity in bulk SOM 14 C in Swiss forest soils that en-compass diverse landscapes and climates. We examine spa-tial variability in soil organic carbon (SOC) 14 C, SOC con-tent and C : N ratios over both regional climatic and geologic gradients, on the watershed-and plot-scale and within soil profiles. Results reveal (1) a relatively uniform radiocarbon signal across climatic and geologic gradients in Swiss forest topsoils (0–5 cm, 14 C = 130 ± 28.6, n = 12 sites), (2) simi-lar radiocarbon trends with soil depth despite dissimilar envi-ronmental conditions, and (3) micro-topography dependent, plot-scale variability that is similar in magnitude to regional-scale variability (e.g., Gleysol, 0–5 cm, 14 C 126 ± 35.2, n = 8 adjacent plots of 10 × 10 m). Statistical analyses have additionally shown that 14 C signature in the topsoil is not significantly correlated to climatic parameters (precipitation, elevation, primary production) except mean annual temper-ature at 0–5 cm. These observations have important conse-quences for SOM carbon stability modelling assumptions, as well as for the understanding of controls on past and current soil carbon dynamics.},

Plant-derived inputs can accumulate in the soil and become part of the soil C pool (“new soil C”), or accelerate losses of pre-existing (“old”) soil C. The dynamics of the new and old pools will likely differ and alter the long-term fate of soil C, but these separate pools, which can be distinguished through isotopic labeling, have not been considered in past syntheses. Using meta-analysis, we found that while elevated CO2 (ranging from 550 to 800 parts per million by volume) stimulates the accumula- tion of new soil C in the short term ({$<$}1 year), these effects do not persist in the longer term (1–4 years). Elevated CO2 does not affect the decomposition or the size of the old soil C pool over either temporal scale. Our results are inconsistent with predictions of conventional soil C models and suggest that elevated CO2 might increase turnover rates of new soil C. Because increased turnover rates of new soil C limit the potential for additional soil C sequestration, the capacity of land ecosys- tems to slow the rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations may be smaller than previously},

Regions with large SOC storage and high variability can serve as natural laboratories to investigate how environmental factors generate vertical and horizontal SOC patterns across the landscape. This was investigated in the Santa Fe River watershed (SFRW), Florida, where we modelled the spatial distribution of total C (TC) at four depths to 180 cm (0-30, 30-60, 60-120, and 120-180 cm) and at an aggregated depth of 0-100 cm. A total of 554 samples from 141 sampling sites distributed along land use and soil order combinations were analyzed for TC by high-temperature combustion. A vertical trend of TC stocks decreasing with depth was identified. Horizontal trends of TC were modelled to identify the environmental determinants of TC in the SFRW. We used analysis of variance (ANOVA) and compared regression block kriging with lognormal block kriging to scale up TC across the SFRW. Total soil C was influenced by soil depth, land use, soil type, soil drainage class, and geologic unit. Regression kriging performed better than block kriging to scale up TC at three out of five depth intervals. This indicates that in the majority of cases environmental factors were the major determinants of the spatial distribution of TC relative to its spatial autocorrelation. At 60-120 and 120-180 cm, the local spatial dependence of TC was more important than environmental factors to explain its variation across the watershed. Our models show that 54.0 Tg (teragrams) of C is held in the upper 1 m of soils in the SFRW, and significant amounts are stored in deeper layers. They also identified the major factors responsible for regional spatial patterns of TC in this subtropical region, providing information to support current efforts of conservation of soil resources in Florida, and under similar environmental conditions in the southeastern U.S. and elsewhere. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in champagne winemaking were tested for their ability to metabolise acetic acid during alcoholic fermentation. Fermentation tests were performed in conditions close to oenological ones using a Chardonnay grape juice supplemented with acetic acid. The amount of acetic acid metabolised by wine yeast increased with increasing initial acetic acid concentration and this elimination occurred during the second part of the exponential growth phase. When the initial acetic acid concentration exceeds 1 g/l, and whatever the yeast strain used, the concentration of acetic acid in the resulting wine cannot be reduced to an acceptable level according to the current legislation. Acetic acid removal modified yeast metabolism, since more acetaldehyde, less glycerol and less succinic acid were produced. Considering the reduction of the NADPH/NADP+ ratio following acetic acid consumption, we propose, as a new hypothesis, that acetic acid could modify yeast metabolism by reducing the activity of the NADP+ dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase Ald6p. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, because of the increasing pressure brought by the public opinion, the attempts to assign an economic, yet volatile, valuation to ecosystems assets has multiplied in recent years, and policy communities are increasingly compelled to incorporate them into land use planning initiatives. Based on contributions to this special issue, we discuss how the perspective of ecosystem services can contribute to develop sound land-use policies and planning actions. Beyond valuation, several practical implications emerge from the contributions. A myriad of potential tradeoffs must be analyzed because since the provision of some services can be accompanied by the emergence of unexpected dis-services. For example, carbon accumulation based on increasing net primary production rates may simultaneously cut water yields and, hence, water provision. Various existing mechanisms ranging from state-controlled to market-controlled for rewarding the provision of ecosystem services are analyzed and discussed in terms of their capacity to connect nature to land-use planning. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Bulk density is a fundamental soil property that is difficult to determine for gravelly to extremely gravelly soils because results vary significantly with sample volume. For such coarse soils, the representative volume (for whole-soil bulk density) should be large, but guidelines for selecting an appropriate sample volume do not exist. We evaluated the representative volume for a soil with abundant rock fragments, by comparing measured properties of samples ranging in volume from 0.03 to 410 L. For whole-soil bulk density determination, the representative volume is 4 L or larger for a soil horizon containing 34\% (v/v) gravel and is between 5 and 50 L for a soil horizon containing 54\% gravel. Intact samples of that size are prohibitively large, so we developed an alternative approach that starts with measurement of fine-earth bulk density. For fine-earth bulk density, the sample volume needed for representative results is between 0.2 and 1 L for gravelly to extremely gravelly soils. The alternative approach reliably synthesizes whole-soil bulk density using (i) fine-earth bulk density from modest-sized samples, (ii) mass-size distribution from large ({$>$}40 kg) representative disturbed samples, and (iii) rock fragment bulk densities. The mass and volume of rock fragments that should be in a sample are added to the mass and volume used to calculate fine-earth bulk density. This method allows integration of lateral variability in the soil without the consequence of averaging properties across a large depth range.},

However, an important and unexplained variability in the changes in SOC with NT adoption exists, which impedes accurate prediction of its potential for C sequestration. We performed a meta-analysis with pedo-climatic and crop factors observed to influence SOC storage under NT at local and regional scales, in order to determine those better explaining this variability at a global scale. We studied SOC stocks (0–30 cm) in an equivalent soil mass, climatic and soil characteristics in 92 NT–IT paired cases. A sub-base with the 35 pairs providing C inputs was used to test their effect. Greater SOC stocks were observed with NT, with a smaller difference than often described (6.7\%, i.e. 3.4 Mg C ha−1). Crop C inputs differences was the only factor significantly and positively related to SOC stock differences between NT and IT, explaining 30\% of their variability. The variability in SOC storage induced by NT conversion seems largely related to the variability of the crop production response. Changes at the agro-ecosystem level, not only in soil, should be considered when assessing the potential of NT for C sequestration.},

  abstract = {This paper reports a first attempt to develop a simple, quantitative, non-destructive and inexpensive methodology to characterise the mineral composition of soil using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). Although there are studies that qualitatively characterise soil minerals using DRS, few studies quantify their composition in soil. Our aims were to: (i) design an experiment that may be used to model mineral-organic mixes as a function of their ultra violet (UV), visible (vis) and near infrared (NIR) diffuse reflectance spectra and (ii) use these models to predict the mineral-organic composition of independent test mixes. Our experiments used a three-factor simplex lattice design with three levels, corresponding to kaolinite (K), illite (I) and smectite (S). To this simplex we added two levels of goethite (G) and two levels of a 50/50 mix of humic and fulvic acids (H-F). Finally we added 3 levels of quartz (Q) to the mixes. We modelled the data using the partial least squares regression 1 algorithm (PLSR1) and made predictions using bootstrap aggregation-PLSR (or bagging-PLSR). The numbers of factors in the PLSR models were selected by leave-one-out cross-validation. These models were independently tested using mixes that we made up to roughly represent the mineral-organic composition of common Australian soils. Predictions of the amount of K, I and S in the test mixes were accurate (RMSE = 3.6, 3.4 and 3.4\%, respectively). Predictions of goethite and the H-F mix were biased. Predictions of Q were very poor as quartz does not have a spectral response in the UV-vis-NIR. A principal components analysis (PCA) was used to compare the spectra of these test mixes with those of corresponding Australian soils. In future work we plan to expand our spectral library and improve the experimental design and our models. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Historically, our understanding of the soil and assessment of its quality and function has been gained through routine soil chemical and physical laboratory analysis. There is a global thrust towards the development of more time- and cost-efficient methodologies for soil analysis as there is a great demand for larger amounts of good quality, inexpensive soil data to be used in environmental monitoring, modelling and precision agriculture. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy provides a good alternative that may be used to enhance or replace conventional methods of soil analysis, as it overcomes some of their limitations. Spectroscopy is rapid, timely, less expensive, non-destructive, straightforward and sometimes more accurate than conventional analysis. Furthermore, a single spectrum allows for simultaneous characterisation of various soil properties and the techniques are adaptable for 'on-the-go' field use. The aims of this paper are threefold: (i) determine the value of qualitative analysis in the visible (VIS) (400-700 nm), near infrared (NIR) (700-2500 nm) and mid infrared (MIR) (2500-25,000 nm); (ii) compare the simultaneous predictions of a number of different soil properties in each of these regions and the combined VIS-NIR-MIR to determine whether the combined information produces better predictions of soil properties than each of the individual regions; and (iii) deduce which of these regions may be best suited for simultaneous analysis of various soil properties. In this instance we implemented partial least-squares regression (PLSR) to construct calibration models, which were independently validated for the prediction of various soil properties from the soil spectra. The soil properties examined were soil pH Ca, pHw, lime requirement (LR), organic carbon (OC), clay, silt, sand, cation exchange capacity (CEC), exchangeable calcium (Ca), exchangeable aluminium (Al), nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), available phosphorus (PCol), exchangeable potassium (K) and electrical conductivity (EC). Our results demonstrated the value of qualitative soil interpretations using the loading weight vectors from the PLSR decomposition. The MIR was more suitable than the VIS or NIR for this type of analysis due to the higher incidence spectral bands in this region as well as the higher intensity and specificity of the signal. Quantitatively, the accuracy of PLSR predictions in each of the VIS, NIR, MIR and VIS-NIR-MIR spectral regions varied considerably amongst properties. However, more accurate predictions were obtained using the MIR for pH, LR, OC, CEC, clay, silt and sand contents, P and EC. The NIR produced more accurate predictions for exchangeable Al and K than any of the ranges. There were only minor improvements in predictions of clay, silt and sand content using the combined VIS-NIR-MIR range. This work demonstrates the potential of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy using the VIS, NIR and MIR for more efficient soil analysis and the acquisition of soil information. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {This chapter reviews proximal soil sensing (PSS). Our intent is for it to be a source of up-to-date information on PSS, the technologies that are currently available and their use for measuring soil properties. We first define PSS and discuss the sampling dilemma. Using the range of frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum as a framework, we describe technologies that can be used for PSS, including electrochemical and mechanical sensors, telemetry, geographic positioning and elevation, multisensor platforms, and core measuring and down-borehole sensors. Because soil properties can be measured with different proximal soil sensors we provide examples of the alternative techniques that are available for measuring soil properties. We also indicate the developmental stage of technologies for PSS and the current approximate cost of commercial sensors. Our discussion focuses on the development of PSS over the past 30. years and on its current state. Finally, we provide a short list of general considerations for future work and suggest that we need research and development to: (i) improve soil sampling designs for PSS, (ii) define the most suitable technique or combination of techniques for measuring key soil properties, (iii) better understand the interactions between soil and sensor signals, (iv) derive theoretical sensor calibrations, (v) understand the basis for local versus global sensor calibrations, (vi) improve signal processing, analysis and reconstruction techniques, (vii) derive and improve methods for sensor data fusion, and (viii) explore the many and varied soil, agricultural, and environmental applications where proximal soil sensors could be used. PSS provides soil scientists with an effective approach to learn more about soils. Proximal soil sensors allow rapid and inexpensive collection of precise, quantitative, fine-resolution data, which can be used to better understand soil spatial and temporal variability. We hope that this review raises awareness about PSS to further its research and development and to encourage the use of proximal soil sensors in different applications. PSS can help provide sustainable solutions to the global issues that we face: food, water, and energy security and climate change. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Conventional analytical methods are time-consuming, expensive and impractical, particularly for measuring at depth. Here we demonstrate the use of proximal soil sensors for estimating the total soil organic C stocks and their accuracies in the 0-10 cm, 0-30 cm and 0-100 cm layers, and for mapping the stocks in each of the three depth layers across 2837 ha of grazing land. Sampling locations were selected by probability sampling, which allowed design-based, model-assisted and model-based estimation of the total organic C stock in the study area. We show that spectroscopic and gamma attenuation sensors can produce accurate measures of soil organic C and bulk density at the sampling locations, in this case every 5 cm to a depth of 1 m. Interpolated data from a mobile multisensor platform were used as covariates in Cubist to map soil organic C. The Cubist map was subsequently used as a covariate in the model-assisted and model-based estimation of the total organic C stock. The design-based, model-assisted and model-based estimates of the total organic C stocks in the study area were similar. However, the variances of the model-assisted and model-based estimates were smaller compared to those of the design-based method. The model-based method produced the smallest variances for all three depth layers. Maps helped to assess variability in the C stock of the study area. The contribution of the spectroscopic model prediction error to our uncertainty about the total soil organic C stocks was relatively small. We found that in soil under unimproved pastures, remnant vegetation and forests there is good rationale for measuring soil organic C beyond the commonly recommended depth of 0-30 cm.},

Thus, our understanding of C cycling is incomplete, which makes it difficult to predict C gains and losses due to changes in climate, land use and management. Here we show that controls on the composition of organic C, the particulate, humus and resistant fractions, and the potential vulnerability of C to decomposition across Australia are distinct, scale-dependent and variable. We used machine-learning with 5,721 topsoil measurements to show that, continentally, the climate, soil properties (for example, total nitrogen and pH) and elevation are dominant controls. However, we found that such general assessments disregard underlying region-specific controls that affect the distribution of the organic C fractions and vulnerability. This can lead to misinterpretations that prejudice our understanding of soil C processes and dynamics. Regionally, climate is mediated through interactions with soil properties, mineralogy and topography. In some regions, climate is uninfluential. These results highlight the need for regional assessments of soil C dynamics and more local parameterization of biogeochemical and Earth system models. Our analysis propounds the development of region-specific strategies for effective C management and climate change mitigation.},

But the selection of the key variables for an identification of management zones, required for precision agriculture, is not straightforward. To investigate a procedure for this selection, an 8 ha agricultural field in the Loess belt of Belgium was considered for this study. The available information consisted of: (i) top- and subsoil samples taken at 110 locations, on which soil properties: textural fractions, organic carbon (OC), CaCO3 and pH were analysed, (ii) soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) obtained through an electromagnetic induction based sensor, and (iii) wetness index, stream power index and steepest slope angle derived from a detailed digital elevation model (DEM). A principal component analysis, involving 12 soil and topographic properties and two ECa variables, identified three components explaining 67.4\% of the total variability. These three components were best represented by pH, ECa that strongly associated with texture and OC. However, OC was closely related to some more readily obtainable topographic properties, and therefore elevation was preferred. A fuzzy k-means classification of these three variables produced four potential management classes. Three-year average standardized yield maps of grain and straw showed productivity differences across these classes, but mainly linked to their landscape position. In the loess area with complex soil-landscape interactions pH, ECa and elevation can be considered as key properties to delineate potential management classes. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we incubated pre-produced artificial soils (842 days) and a natural soil (Ap, Luvisol) with \textsuperscript{13}C- and \textsuperscript{15}N-labelled plant litter over 63 days to follow OM turnover and the formation of organo-mineral associations regarding different compositions (montmorillonite (MT), illite (IL), montmorillonite + charcoal (MT+CH), illite + ferrihydrite (IL+FH)). The microbial biomass, salt extractable organic C, the isotopic C and N composition in the bulk soil and the soil fractions (combined density and particle size fractionation) were determined. By comparison of the artificial soils with the natural soil, we were able to show that the produced soil-like systems have OM dynamics comparable to the natural soil. We found out that the decomposition of the added plant litter was affected by the type of clay mineral that formed the artificial soils, as the soil MT exhibited a slower mineralisation compared to IL, which was in line with a lower microbial biomass. Although a high specific surface area (SSA) provides a high sequestration capacity for C and N, smaller amounts were sequestered in the MT soil with a higher SSA compared to the soil IL. We suppose that a more intensive decomposition is associated with a higher microbial biomass and thus leads to higher amounts of microbial products sequestered in the clay-sized fraction. Charcoal and ferrihydrite had no additional effect in this experiment.},

  abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) consists of various functional pools that are stabilized by specific mechanisms and have certain turnover rates. For the development of mechanistic models that predict changes in SOM storage, these pools have to be quantified and characterized. In the past, numerous fractionation schemes have been developed to separate and analyse such SOM fractions. In this review, the SOM fractions obtained with such operational fractionation procedures are described in terms of their pool sizes, chemical properties, and turnover rates. The main objective of this review is to evaluate these operationally defined fractions with respect to their suitability to describe functional SOM pools that could be used to parameterize SOM turnover models. Fractionation procedures include (1) physical separation of SOM into aggregate, particle size, and density fractions and fractions according to their magnetic susceptibility, and (2) various wet chemical procedures that fractionate SOM according to solubility, hydrolysability, and resistance to oxidation or by destruction of the mineral phase. Furthermore, combinations of fractionation methods are evaluated. The active SOM pool with turnover rates {$<$}10 years may best be represented by the soil microbial biomass and the light fraction ({$<$}1.6-2 g cm-3) obtained by density fractionation (if black carbon contents are considered). Most chemical and physical fractionations as well as combinations of methods yield SOM fractions that are not homogeneous in terms of turnover rates. It has proven to be particularly difficult to isolate functional fractions that represent the passive model pools in which the majority of soil SOM is stabilized. The available fractionation methods do not correspond to specific stabilization mechanisms and hence do not describe functional SOM pools. Another problem is that comprehensive data for turnover rates and data for whole soil profiles are only now becoming available, especially for new fractionation methods. Such information as well as the use of specific markers and compound-specific isotope analysis may be important for future differentiation and evaluation of functional SOM fractions. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The model concept relates the diverse stabilization mechanisms to active, intermediate, and passive pools. The formation of the passive pool is regarded as hierarchical structured co-action of various processes that are active under specific pedogenetic conditions. To evaluate the model, we used data of pool sizes and turnover times of soil OM fractions from horizons of two acid forest and two agricultural soils. Selective preservation of recalcitrant compounds is relevant in the active pool and particularly in soil horizons with high C contents. Biogenic aggregation preserves OM in the intermediate pool and is limited to topsoil horizons. Spatial inaccessibility due to the occlusion of OM in clay microstructures and due to the formation of hydrophobic surfaces stabilizes OM in the passive pool. If present, charcoal contributes to the passive pool mainly in topsoil horizons. The importance of organo-mineral interactions for OM stabilization in the passive pool is well-known and increases with soil depth. Hydrophobicity is particularly relevant in acid soils and in soils with considerable inputs of charcoal. We conclude that the stabilization potentials of soils are site- and horizon-specific. Furthermore, management affects key stabilization mechanisms. Tillage increases the importance of organo-mineral interactions for OM stabilization, and in Ap horizons with high microbial activity and C turnover, organo-mineral interactions can contribute to OM stabilization in the intermediate pool. The application of our model showed that we need a better understanding of processes causing spatial inaccessibility of OM to decomposers in the passive pool.},

Deep soil carbon is of particular interest as it represents large stocks and its turnover times remain highly uncertain. In this study, SOM dynamics in both the top and deep soil across a climatic (av- erage temperature ∼1–9 ◦C) gradient are determined using time-series (∼ 20 years) 14C data from bulk soil and water- extractable organic carbon (WEOC). Analytical measure- ments reveal enrichment of bomb-derived radiocarbon in the deep soil layers on the bulk level during the last 2 decades. The WEOC pool is strongly enriched in bomb-derived car- bon, indicating that it is a dynamic pool. Turnover time esti- mates of both the bulk and WEOC pool show that the latter cycles up to a magnitude faster than the former. The pres- ence of bomb-derived carbon in the deep soil, as well as the rapidly turning WEOC pool across the climatic gradient, im- plies that there likely is a dynamic component of carbon in the deep soil. Precipitation and bedrock type appear to ex- ert a stronger influence on soil C turnover time and stocks as compared to temperature.},

The factors controlling the pool size and chemistry in these fractions, especially those in m-LF, are unclear. We examined the influence of climate and parent material on SOM in these fractions using two sets of forest soils (0-10 cm mineral horizon) developed from contrasting parent materials (metasedimentary vs. ultrabasic igneous rock) along an altitudinal gradient in Mt. Kinabalu, Borneo. From 700 m to upper altitudes (1700, 2700 m), where mean annual temperature decreases from 24 to 12 °C with roughly constant rainfall, surface soil C stocks on both parent materials increased from 2.6-2.8 to 5.4-7.5 kg m- 2 with progressively greater proportions in m-LF and, to less extent, fresher plant detritus fractions. In HF, C and N concentrations increased with altitude though their stocks were roughly constant due to progressively lower bulk density. Labile C assessed by laboratory incubation of bulk soils correlated better with C concentrations in the two LF pools than in HF, especially at the lowest altitude where most SOM is strongly associated with minerals as HF. These results suggest that LF pools are more labile and more sensitive to altitude-induced, climate differences as compared to the HF pool that is protected by the mineral matrix. The C:N ratios of HF on metasedimentary rock increased with altitude (11 to 17) while those on ultrabasic rock remained essentially constant (14-15), implying interactive influence of altitude and parent material on stoichiometry. Unusually high C:N and alkyl-C in m-LF were found in mid-altitude soils, suggesting selective preservation of inherently recalcitrant materials in addition to, or instead of, mineral coating or aggregate occlusion of partially-degraded LF by microbial metabolites. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We review the literature on these separations, with a focus on the low-density material released by sonication, the so-called "occluded", "aggregate- protected" or mineral-associated low-density fraction (m-LF). This fraction accounts for up to half of the total C in surface soils. A commonly cited model explains this material as an intermediary (between mineral-free LF and high-density fractions) during the progressive decay of plant detritus accompanied by mineral association. However, the great variance in m-LF compositions (e.g. unusual aliphaticity, high C:N, variable mean residence time) shown in the literature implies a separate genesis for some of the organic matter in this fraction in some soils. Aspects of organic particle size and lipid composition of original plant sources deserve more attention. We propose a revision of the current model that allows for materials of widely varying lability in this pool. A combination of density separation with isotope tracers, detailed chemical characterization and other physical separation techniques are needed to improve models of soil organic matter dynamics linking the density fractions. © 2009 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.},

Soil nitrogen is often predominantly organic and might serve as a proxy for OM. We therefore investigated nitrogen associations with Fe and Al using several selective extractants that use reductive, complexation, and alkaline approaches. Total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) correlated strongly with extracted Fe and Al across seventeen samples, including highly- and weakly-weathered soils, iron-rich ultrabasic soils, podzolic, and volcanic soils. Typically a quarter to a third of total soil nitrogen was dissolved by the various extractions, though higher fractions (up to 60\%) were found in spodic-horizon and volcanic surface-horizon samples. Similar proportions were found for OC, using three OC-free extractants, indicating that TDN provides a useful surrogate for assessing OM partitioning via extractants that contain OC. Use of TDN:metal ratios in extractant solutions allows estimation of extracted OM that could have been sorptively associated with metal oxide/hydroxides and poorly-crystalline aluminosilicates. These ratios were often high in extractions targeted at these adsorbents, and imply that usually most of the extracted TDN consists instead of organo-metal complexes. The dynamics of these complexes may have stronger control on accumulation/remobilization of soil OM than those of metal oxyhydroxides and poorly-crystalline aluminosilicates. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  abstract = {Organic matter (OM) bound to soil mineral particles (higher-density particles) tends to be more stabilized, enriched in 13 C and 15 N, and has a lower C:N ratio. Yet how these variations in OM chemistry are linked to the nature of organo-mineral assemblage remains poorly understood, especially in allophanic soils where high amounts of OM are stabilized by interactions with reactive inorganic phases such as short-range-order (SRO) minerals. We thus assessed the extent to which the degree of aggregation and its disruption during fractionation control the distribution and chemistry of the soil organo-mineral particles across six density fractions using a volcanic soil (allophanic Andisol) based on selective dissolution, microscopy (SEM), solid-state 13 C NMR spectroscopy and δ 13 C and δ 15 N analyses. Intermediate-density fractions (2.0-2.5gcm -3 ) accounted for 63-86\% of organic C and N, 73-93\% of pyrophosphate-extractable iron and aluminum (Fep, Alp), and 78-95\% of oxalate-extractable metals (Feo, Alo) in the bulk soil sample. While air-drying pretreatment had little effect, sonication during fractionation led to (i) fragmentation of both plant detritus and some of the aggregates of 30-100mm sizes, (ii) release of occluded low-density fraction ({$<$}1.6gcm -3 ) which largely originated from the aggregates of 1.6-2.0gcm -3 density range, and (iii) redistribution of organo-mineral particles (15-16\% of total OM and 7-19\% of the extractable metals) within the intermediate density fractions. Positive correlation of Alp with C:N ratio and negative correlation of Alp with δ 15 N among the fractions suggest preferential binding of Alp phase (e.g., organo-Al complexes) to decaying plant detritus. Positive correlation of Alo and Feo with δ 15 N, together with theoretical density calculations of idealistic organo-mineral association modes, suggests that 15 N enrichment may be coupled with OM binding to SRO minerals and with the formation of physically-stable aggregates of micron/submicron sizes in accord with our conceptual model (Asano and Wagai, 2014). The general pattern of 13 C and 15 N enrichment and C:N decline with increasing particle density remained largely unchanged despite the sonication effects detected, indicating that sonication-resistant organo-mineral assemblages largely control the observed patterns. The similarity in the density-dependent changes of OM chemistry between the studied Andisol and the soils with crystalline clay and metal oxide mineralogies in previous studies strongly suggests a common biogeochemical control which deserves further investigation.},

  abstract = {Interaction of organic matter (OM) with soil mineral components plays a critical role in biophysical organization (aggregate structure) as well as in biogeochemical cycling of major elements. Of the mineral components, poorly-crystalline phases rich in iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al) are highly reactive and thus contribute to both OM stabilization and aggregation. However, the functional relationship among the reactive metal phases, C stability, and aggregation remains elusive. We hypothesized that relatively young C acts as a binding agent to form the aggregates of weak physical stability, whereas the reactive metal phases and older C bound to them contribute to stronger aggregation. Using four surface horizons of Andisols having a gradient of soil C concentration due to decadal OM management, we conducted sequential density fractionation to isolate six fractions (from {$<$}1.6 to {$>$}2.5 g cm−3) with mechanical shaking, followed by selective dissolution and radiocarbon analysis. After 28 years of no-till with litter compost addition, not only C and N but inorganic materials including the reactive metal phases (pyrophosphate-, oxalate-, and dithionite-extractable metals) showed clear shifts in their concentrations towards lower-density fractions (especially {$<$}2.0 g cm−3) on a ground-area basis. This result was explained by the binding of compost-derived OMwith soil particles. Major portions of the reactive metal phases in bulk samples were distributed in mid-density fractions (2.0–2.5 g cm−3) largely as sonication-resistant aggregates. Theoretical density calculations, together with depletion in radiocarbon (∆14C: −82 to −170‰) and lower C:N ratio, implied that the sorptive capacity of the reactive metal phases in these fractions were roughly saturated with pre-existing OM. However, the influx of the compost-derived, modern C into the mid-density fractions detected by the paired-plot comparison suggests decadal C sink in association with the reactive metal phase. Our results supported the concept of aggregate hierarchy and further provided the following new insights. At the high hierarchy level where shaking-resistant aggregates form, soil organo-mineral particles appeared to be under a dynamic equilibrium and the changes in OM input regime controlled (dis)aggregation behavior due to the binding effect of relatively young C. At a lower hierarchy level, the reactive metal phases were bound to N-rich, 14C-depleted OM and together functioned as persistent binding agent. Our study suggests that the recognition of binding agents and aggregate hierarchy level would help to untangle the complex organo-mineral interactions and to better understand soil C stability.},

The spatial variability study was carried out on a 38000 ha area using 5141 topsoil electrical conductivity (EC) measurements systematically sampled on a 250 m by 250 m grid. Variography analysis confirmed the existence of large trends in the EC variability with differing spatial structures between sub-areas.OKLV performed better than ordinary kriging with a whole-area variogram (OKWV) in predicting the proportion of high saline soils in large blocks, but the predictions appeared mostly similar. In contrast, the estimation variance maps revealing the uncertainties of the spatial predictions were markedly different between the 2 methods. OKLV integrates the local spatial structure in the uncertainty assessment, whereas kriging with a whole-area variogram only considers the sampling intensity. Comparison with prediction errors on a validation set confirmed the consistency of the OKLV prediction variance. This appears to be a major improvement for decision-making procedures such as delineating areas where remediation should take place.},

Bulk density determined with 100-cm3 sample rings was defined as the reference method (REF). All methods were tested at five depth increments in nine subplots at four sites with differing soil texture and SOC content. All methods determined BD in the depth increments with low systematic error (8\% for probes and 2\% for sample rings). The random error of the probe samples was, on average, 50\% higher than that of the ring samples when the cores of the probes were adequately corrected for com- paction or stretching. The BD was significantly overestimated (by 2\%) when determined with MINI rings, and the variation in BD was not reduced with BIG sample rings rather than the smaller REF sample rings. The performance of the driving hammer technique varied widely among probe types and sites. The sheath probe had the smallest systematic error of all probes tested and is recommended for soil inventories. All methods for estimating BD had smaller errors than pedotransfer functions.},

This study was conducted to determine whether HCl vapor completely removes carbonates even in dolomiterich soils and to what extent a widely used acid-fumigation method has to be modified for humus-rich soils. Furthermore, it was tested whether HCl fumigation alters organic-C content. Since C and N parameters are often analyzed simultaneously we also tested the influence of acid-vapor treatment on N content and on d13C of soil organic matter. We applied fumigation with 37\% HCl for 8 and 32 h using 9 carbonate-containing soil samples. Inorganic C ranged from 7 to 124 and organic C from 9 to 267 g kg–1. The maximum contents of dolomite and calcite were 940 and 640 g kg–1, respectively. A time of 8 h was enough to completely remove all carbonates. Neither the content nor the d13C of organic C were significantly affected by fumigation. In contrast, N contents were altered by acid treatment. Based on these results and on our experience in analyzing more than 1000 soil samples, a recommended procedure for acid fumigation of carbonate-containing soils with a wide range of organic- and inorganic-C contents was derived. Samples pretreated in this way can be analyzed reliably for their organic-C content and d13C. Furthermore, N and inorganic-C contents can be determined with a quality sufficient for many purposes.},

Two k-means algorithms are described, one for unequal area and one for equal area partitioning. The R package is illustrated with three examples: (1) subsampling of square and circular sampling plots commonly used in surveys of soil, vegetation, forest, etc.; (2) sampling of agricultural fields for soil testing; and (3) infill sampling of climate stations for mainland Australia and Tasmania.

  abstract = {©2000 by the American Geophysical union. The rate of carbon( C) cycling in soils is controlled by an array of processes and conditions. It has been widely accepted that an increase in temperature would accelerate microbial decomposition of soil organic matter( SOM) and provide a positive feedback to global warming, other factors being equal. However, soil moisture has received little attention in C cycle studies. In this project, we developed a technique for samplings oil-respired CO 2 for isotopic measurements a model that relates the radiocarbon ( 14 C) content of soil respired CO 2 to the rate of C cycling in soils. We measured soil CO 2 flux, carbon isotopic content (both 13 C and 14 C) of soil-respired CO 2 , soil temperature, and soil moisture on a monthly basis along an elevation transect in the Sierra Nevada in an attempt to determine the relationship between the rate of soil C cycling and soil environmental conditions Both soil CO 2 flux and its 14 C content displayed significant variations( spatially and temporally),which reflect natural variations in the rate of SOM decomposition and in the relative amount of SOM-derived CO 2 versus root-respired CO 2 caused by seasonal changes in soil temperature ,moisture ,and plant activity. The relative contribution of SOM decomposition to total soil CO 2 production changed throughout the year from •- 20 - 50\% at the peak of the growing season to closet o 100\% in the nongrowing season. The apparent decay rate of SOM determined from the 14 C content of soil-respired CO 2 varied from• 0.2yr -1 in the spring to - 0.01yr -1 in the fall at the lowest-elevation site and from 0 .1 yr-1 in the summer to • 0.01yr -1 in the late fall at the highest-elevation site .It appears that the apparent decay rate of SOM increased with increasing temperature when soil moisture was adequate but decreased with increasing temperature when soil moisture became limited. The apparent decay rate of SOM also varied with soil moisture. Higher soil moisture content accelerated decomposition of SOM until it reached an optimal level of- 14 - 25 wt \% water content and then inhibited decomposition when more pores in soils became saturated with water and perhaps oxygen availability( for microbes) became limited. Although the rate of SOM decomposition varied throughout the year in response to fluctuations in soil temperature and moisture ,the maximum apparent decay rate was higher at the low-elevation site (i.e., maximum apparent decay rate= 0.22y r- •) than at the high-elevation sites(i .e., maximum apparent decay rate= 0.10y r-•). Litter decomposition simulated by measuring changes in mass of litter in litter bags placed in the field also showed a similar decomposition pattern with decreasing decomposition rate with elevation. Multivariable regression analyses including various terms of soil temperature, moisture, and site variability suggest that soil moisture was a major factor, but not the only factor, controlling the rate of SOM decomposition and soil CO2 flux in the Sierra Nevada soils. Both decay rate and total soil CO 2 flux are related significantly to soil moisture ,temperature ,and site effects.},

The sediments were collected from canal, wetland, river, estuary, lake, and marine sites. The organic and inorganic C contents of these samples ranged from 1 to 430 g kg( -1) and from 4 to 97 g kg( -1), respectively. Combinations of the combustion time and temperature and optimal weight ranges of representative samples were tested, and comparisons of the WLOI method with other methods, including dry combustion and wet combustion, were made. These methods were (1) use of the carbon-nitrogen-sulfur (CNS) autoanalyzer with normal and reduced temperatures for total and organic C, (2) thermogravimetry for both organic and inorganic C, (3) use of the CNS autoanalyzer after removal of inorganic (carbonate) C by fumigating samples with concentrated HCl for organic C, (4) Walkley-Black wet combustion method for organic C, and (5) pressure-calcimeter associated with subtraction method (total C minus inorganic C) for organic C determinations. The results of analyzing samples of sediments of diverse origins showed that the optimal combination of temperature and time of WLOI depended mostly on the sources of the analyzed sediment. The WLOI analysis of sediment samples for organic C from wetlands, canal, estuary, or river sites needed a relatively low temperature but that of sediment samples from lake and marine sites required a relatively high temperature. Overall, to obtain reliable analysis results of samples from widely varied sediment sources except marine sediments, 500°C for 12 h was optimal for organic C content determination, and 800°C for yet another 12 h was optimal for inorganic C content determination. The temperature could even be reduced to 475°C if only wetland and stream sediments were included, but for marine sediments, 550°C for 12 h was necessary. Precise C content determinations for most sediment sources could be obtained by WLOI when sample quantities ranged from 2.0 to 4.0 g. The WLOI method, when conducted properly, resulted in precise measurements of C contents in "standard samples" used for calibration, and these values were closely comparable to results obtained with other dry combustion methods (R (2) ≥ 0.96). We conclude that WLOI, which has advantages of simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and no waste disposal over other methods, can provide precise measurements of organic and inorganic C contents in sediments from a wide range of sources, but the selection of heating temperature and exposure time should be carefully considered based on sediment sources.},

The extent of carbon and nitrogen sequestration in soils under steppe systems in relation to surface gravel mulch remains largely unexplored. This study investigated the effects of gravel mulches on soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks in the arid and windy regions of the Tibetan Plateau. Surface gravel mulches provide a more favorable environment for soil carbon and nitrogen stocks than do non-mulched sites. Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks were highest (46.9Mgha-1 SOC and 2.8Mgha-1 TN) in the medium gravel mulch sites with \$\textbackslash sim\$40-50\% gravel, and lowest (29.5Mgha-1 SOC and 1.4Mgha-1 TN) in no gravel mulch sites. Analysis of aggregate size fractions indicated that the vast majority of SOC was present in microaggregate fractions throughout the top 30cm of soil. Considering the low level of soil disturbance in the study area, the carbon contained in the macroaggregate fraction might become stabilized in the soil. Gravel mulches above the soil surface have an important bearing on soil carbon sequestration as they control wind erosion, decrease soil surface evaporation and change soil physical behavior in the arid and semiarid regions. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

However, reliably measuring SOC turnover rates at large spatial and temporal scales remains challenging. Here we use a natural carbon isotope approach, defined as beta (β), which was quantified from the δ\textsuperscript{13}C of vegetation and soil reported in the literature (182 separate soil profiles), to examine large-scale controls of climate, soil physical properties and nutrients over patterns of SOC turnover across terrestrial biomes worldwide. We report a significant relationship between β and calculated soil C turnover rates (\emph{k}), which were estimated by dividing soil heterotrophic respiration by SOC pools. ln(-β) exhibits a significant linear relationship with mean annual temperature, but a more complex polynomial relationship with mean annual precipitation, implying strong-feedbacks of SOC turnover to climate changes. Soil nitrogen (N) and clay content correlate strongly and positively with ln(-β), revealing the additional influence of nutrients and physical soil properties on SOC decomposition rates. Furthermore, a strong (\emph{R}\textsuperscript{2}\&thinsp;=\&thinsp;0.85; \emph{p}\&thinsp;{$<\&$}thinsp;0.001) linear relationship between ln(-β) and estimates of litter and root decomposition rates suggests similar controls over rates of organic matter decay among the generalized soil C stocks.

  abstract = {Steep soil-mantled hillslopes are thought to be important sources of sediments and organic carbon (OC) to rivers. Minerals in these sediments may protect OC from decomposition, yet the significance of such interactions in steep upland soils remains poorly constrained particularly in relation to erosion rates. We examined a tributary basin draining to the Middle Folk Feather River in California, where knickpoint migration has created a series of hillslopes with erosion rates varying over an order of magnitude (35 to 250 mm kyr−1). This setting provides a unique opportunity to study soil OC pools and their erosional exports as a function of changes in erosion rates. Soil OC inventories were 37\% lower at rapidly eroding sites relative to slowly eroding sites. This difference was driven by coarse rock contents as rapidly eroding soils had more rock fragments, limiting their capacities to store OC. Although clay contents in soils were negatively correlated with erosion rates, the total mineral specific surface area remained relatively invariant. Based on secondary phyllosilicate minerals present in the studied soils and our field observations of saprocks, we suggest that this discrepancy may have originated from different clay mineralogy (types and abundance) associated with different degrees of deep subsurface chemical weathering. Across the erosion gradient, the radiocarbon age of mineral associated organic matter (MOC) in saprock varied by a factor 2 (from 1045 to 2110 14C years), while soil turnover times estimated from soil thickness and erosion rates varied from 17 to 5.4 kyr. At the site eroding at the fastest rate, the soil turnover time approaches the 14C age of MOC, suggesting erosion can potentially limit the timescale over which MOC is replaced. We found that organic matter generally covered {$<$}50\% of the total mineral surface. The remaining OC-free mineral surface area, once eroded, may thus have a significant, and to date unquantified, capacity to adsorb additional organic matter, which may act as a long-term atmospheric carbon sink.},

  abstract = {The importance of managing land to optimise carbon sequestration for climate change mitigation is widely recognised, with grasslands being identified as having the potential to sequester additional carbon. However, most soil carbon inventories only consider surface soils, and most large scale surveys group ecosystems into broad habitats without considering management intensity. Consequently, little is known about the quantity of deep soil carbon and its sensitivity to management. From a nationwide survey of grassland soils to 1 m depth, we show that carbon in grasslands soils is vulnerable to management and that these management effects can be detected to considerable depth down the soil profile, albeit at decreasing significance with depth. Carbon concentrations in soil decreased as management intensity increased, but greatest soil carbon stocks (accounting for bulk density differences), were at intermediate levels of management. Our study also highlights the considerable amounts of carbon in sub-surface soil below 30cm, which is missed by standard carbon inventories. We estimate grassland soil carbon in Great Britain to be 2097 Tg C to a depth of 1 m, with \$\textbackslash sim\$60\% of this carbon being below 30cm. Total stocks of soil carbon (t ha(-1) ) to 1 m depth were 10.7\% greater at intermediate relative to intensive management, which equates to 10.1 t ha(-1) in surface soils (0-30 cm), and 13.7 t ha(-1) in soils from 30-100 cm depth. Our findings highlight the existence of substantial carbon stocks at depth in grassland soils that are sensitive to management. This is of high relevance globally, given the extent of land cover and large stocks of carbon held in temperate managed grasslands. Our findings have implications for the future management of grasslands for carbon storage and climate mitigation, and for global carbon models which do not currently account for changes in soil carbon to depth with management.

  abstract = {Soils represent the largest terrestrial reservoir of organic carbon, and the balance between soil organic carbon (SOC) formation and loss will drive powerful carbon-climate feedbacks over the coming century. To date, efforts to predict SOC dynamics have rested on pool-based models, which assume classes of SOC with internally homogenous physicochemical properties. However, emerging evidence suggests that soil carbon turnover is not dominantly controlled by the chemistry of carbon inputs, but rather by restrictions on microbial access to organic matter in the spatially heterogeneous soil environment. The dynamic processes that control the physicochemical protection of carbon translate poorly to pool-based SOC models; as a result, we are challenged to mechanistically predict how environmental change will impact movement of carbon between soils and the atmosphere. Here, we propose a novel conceptual framework to explore controls on belowground carbon cycling: Probabilistic Representation of Organic Matter Interactions within the Soil Environment (PROMISE). In contrast to traditional model frameworks, PROMISE does not attempt to define carbon pools united by common thermodynamic or functional attributes. Rather, the PROMISE concept considers how SOC cycling rates are governed by the stochastic processes that influence the proximity between microbial decomposers and organic matter, with emphasis on their physical location in the soil matrix. We illustrate the applications of this framework with a new biogeochemical simulation model that traces the fate of individual carbon atoms as they interact with their environment, undergoing biochemical transformations and moving through the soil pore space. We also discuss how the PROMISE framework reshapes dialogue around issues related to SOC management in a changing world. We intend the PROMISE framework to spur the development of new hypotheses, analytical tools, and model structures across disciplines that will illuminate mechanistic controls on the flow of carbon between plant, soil, and atmospheric pools.},

We show that bamboo forest dominated the region for ≥6,000 y and that only small, temporary clearings were made to build the geoglyphs; however, construction occurred within anthropogenic forest that had been actively managed for millennia.

  abstract = {In the global carbon cycle, soil organic matter (SAM) is a major source/sink of atmospheric carbon. Clay minerals stabilize part of the SOM through mineral-organic matter binding. Stabilization of organic matter is essential for tropical soils. Since the climatic conditions of the tropics favor decomposition of organic matter, tropical soils would be very poor in organic matter without this stabilization process. This research aims at determining the effect of clay mineralogy on the amount and composition of organic matter that is bound to the mineral surface. We focused on organic matter that is associated with kaolinite and smectite. We characterized kaolinite- and smectite-associated SOM in soils from seven countries, employing 13C NMR spectroscopy and Py-GC/MS. The content of carbon in the total clay-size fraction showed no significant difference between kaolinitic and smectitic soils. This suggests that the total amount of organic carbon in the clay-size fraction is independent of the clay mineralogy. We first extracted the clay fraction with NaOH and thereafter with Na4P2O7. About half of the kaolinite-associated SOM was extractable by NaOH. In the smectitic soils, pyrophosphate extracted more organic carbon than did NaOH. The Py-GC/MS and NMR results indicate that kaolinite-associated SOM is enriched in polysaccharide products, while smectite-associated organic matter contains many aromatic compounds. We suggest that different clay minerals use different binding mechanisms to complex SOM. As a result, the composition of clay-associated organic matter would be influenced by the type of clay that is dominantly present in the soil. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

In the global C cycle, soil organic matter (SOM) is a major source and sink of atmospheric C. Turnover times of C in these soil organic compounds vary from hours to thousands of years. Clay minerals can stabilize SOM through the formation of organo-mineral bonds. The aim of this research was first, to determine the mean residence time (MRT) of organic matter that is bound to different clay mineral surfaces, and second, to explain the variance in the measured MRTs using multilinear regression. We especially studied organic matter that is bound to kaolinite or smectite. We analyzed the 14C activity of organic matter in the whole and heavy clay-size fraction of kaolinite- and smectite-dominated soils from N'Ropa, in northern Mozambique. The soils originated from natural savanna systems and bamboo forest. We assumed that C inputs and outputs are in equilibrium in such soils, so that the 14C age equals the MRT of the organic C. For both kaolinite- and smectite-dominated soils, the organic matter in the whole and heavy clay-size fraction and extracts had a fast turnover (400-500 yr on average). The MRT of kaolinite-bound organic matter did not differ significantly from that of smectite-bound organic matter. Multiple linear regression indicates that the effective cation-exchange capacity (ECEC) is the main factor to explain variance in the MRT of the extracted SOM. These results agree with previously found trends in organic matter turnover of kaolinite and smectite-associated clay.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystems currently offset one-quarter of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions because of a slight imbalance between global terrestrial photosynthesis and respiration. Understanding what controls these two biological fluxes is therefore crucial to predicting climate change. Yet there is no way of directly measuring the photosynthesis or daytime respiration of a whole ecosystem of interacting organisms; instead, these fluxes are generally inferred from measurements of net ecosystem-atmosphere CO2 exchange (NEE), in a way that is based on assumed ecosystem-scale responses to the environment. The consequent view of temperate deciduous forests (an important CO2 sink) is that, first, ecosystem respiration is greater during the day than at night; and second, ecosystem photosynthetic light-use efficiency peaks after leaf expansion in spring and then declines, presumably because of leaf ageing or water stress. This view has underlain the development of terrestrial biosphere models used in climate prediction and of remote sensing indices of global biosphere productivity. Here, we use new isotopic instrumentation to determine ecosystem photosynthesis and daytime respiration in a temperate deciduous forest over a three-year period. We find that ecosystem respiration is lower during the day than at night - the first robust evidence of the inhibition of leaf respiration by light at the ecosystem scale. Because they do not capture this effect, standard approaches overestimate ecosystem photosynthesis and daytime respiration in the first half of the growing season at our site, and inaccurately portray ecosystem photosynthetic light-use efficiency. These findings revise our understanding of forest-atmosphere carbon exchange, and provide a basis for investigating how leaf-level physiological dynamics manifest at the canopy scale in other ecosystems.},

In recent years the distribution of SOC down the soil profile has become an area of interest in the understanding of the carbon sequestration potential of soils. Most studies however have concentrated on highly disturbed agricultural sites with little data available for untilled locations. In this study the vertical distribution of SOC is examined at a grassland site in the Young River area of Western Australia that has remained undisturbed by human activity for 50years. Soil physical properties (texture, rock content) as well as the distribution of the environmental tracers 137Cs and 210Pb were assessed with the aim of better understanding the transport processes which produce the observed vertical distribution of SOC. While no consistent relationship was found between SOC and soil physical properties significant relationships were found between the distribution of SOC and the environmental tracers, 137Cs and 210Pb. Finite element simulations based on a diffusion/convection/decay model showed that the transport of 137Cs and 210Pb down the soil profile is likely to be driven by the same (primarily diffusive) processes. The same model used in conjunction with plant input and decay data generated from the RothC-26.3 soil carbon model revealed that transport of SOC down the soil profile, while also a diffusion process, was significantly slower indicating that different processes and/or pathways are involved in SOC transport at this site. ?? 2011.},

This study was conducted to quantify potential soil C sequestration rates for different crops in response to decreasing tillage intensity or enhancing rotation complexity, and to estimate the duration of time over which sequestration may occur. Analyses of C sequestration rates were completed using a global database of 67 long-term agricultural experiments, consisting of 276 paired treatments. Results indicate, on average, that a change from conventional tillage (CT) to no-till (NT) can sequester 57 14 g C m(-2) yr(-1), excluding wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow systems which may not result in SOC accumulation with a change from CT to NT. Enhancing rotation complexity can sequester an average 20 12 g C m(-2) yr(-1), excluding a change from continuous corn (Zea mays L.) to corn-soybean (Glycine mar L.) which may not result in a significant accumulation of SOC. Carbon sequestration rates, with a change from CT to NT, can be expected to peak in 5 to 10 yr with SOC reaching a new equilibrium in 15 to 20 yr. Following initiation of an enhancement in rotation complexity, SOC may reach a new equilibrium in approximately 40 to 60 yr. Carbon sequestration rates, estimated for a number of individual crops and crop rotations in this study, can be used in spatial modeling analyses to more accurately predict regional, national, and global C sequestration potentials},

To investigate the interactions between soil minerals and microbes in the rhizosphere, we incubated three types of minerals (ferrihydrite, kaolinite and quartz) and a native soil mineral fraction near roots of a common Californian annual grass, Avena barbata, growing in its resident soil. We followed microbial colonization of these minerals for up to 2.5 months – the plant's lifespan. Bacteria and fungi that colonized mineral surfaces during this experiment differed across mineral types and differed from those in the background soil, implying that microbial colonization was the result of processes in addition to passive movement with water to mineral surfaces. Null model analysis revealed that dispersal limitation was a dominant factor structuring mineral-associated microbial communities for all mineral types. Once bacteria arrived at a mineral surface, capacity for rapid growth appeared important, as ribosomal copy number was significantly correlated with relative enrichment on minerals. Glomeromycota (a phylum associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) appeared to preferentially associate with ferrihydrite surfaces. The mechanisms enabling the colonization of soil minerals may be foundational in shaping the overall soil microbiome composition and development of persistent organic matter in soils.},

  abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays an important role in regulating global climate change, carbon and nutrient cycling in soils, and soil moisture. Organic matter (OM) additions to soils can affect the rate at which SOC is mineralized by microbes, with potentially important effects on SOC stocks. Understanding how pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM) affects the cycling of native SOC (nSOC) and the soil microbes responsible for these effects is important for fire-affected ecosystems as well as for biochar-amended systems. We used an incubation trial with five different soils from National Ecological Observatory Network sites across the United States and 13C-labeled 350°C corn stover PyOM and fresh corn stover OM to trace nSOC-derived CO2 emissions with and without PyOM and OM amendments. We used high-throughput sequencing of rRNA genes to characterize bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities and their responses to PyOM and OM in soils that were previously stored at 280°C. We found that the effects of amendments on nSOC-derived CO2 reflected the unamended soil C status, where relative increases in C mineralization were greatest in low-C soils. OM additions produced much greater effects on nSOC-CO2 emissions than PyOM additions. Furthermore, the magnitude of the microbial community composition change mirrored the magnitude of increases in nSOC-CO2, indicating that a specific subset of microbes was likely responsible for the observed changes in nSOC mineralization. However, PyOM responders differed across soils and did not necessarily reflect a common “charosphere.” Overall, this study suggests that soils that already have low SOC may be particularly vulnerable to short-term increases in SOC loss with OM or PyOM additions. IMPORTANCE Soil organic matter (SOM) has an important role in global climate change, carbon and nutrient cycling in soils, and soil moisture dynamics. Understanding the processes that affect SOM stocks is important for managing these functions. Recently, understanding how fire-affected organic matter (or “pyrogenic” organic matter [PyOM]) affects existing SOM stocks has become increasingly important, due to both changing fire regimes and interest in “biochar,” pyrogenic organic matter that is produced intentionally for carbon management or as an agricultural soil amendment. We found that soils with less SOM were more prone to increased losses with PyOM (and fresh organic matter) additions and that soil microbial communities changed more in soils that also had greater SOM losses with PyOM additions. This suggests that soils that already have low SOM content may be particularly vulnerable to short-term increases in SOM loss and that a subset of the soil microbial community is likely responsible for these effects.},

In order to improve understanding of the response of soil microbial communities to shifts in agricultural management programs, a two year field study was conducted on large-scale conventional, low-input and organic fields associate with the Kellogg Biological Station, Long Term Ecological Research site near Kalamazoo, MI. Because large commercial agricultural fields typically exhibit diverse topography, plots were established in all fields at unique landscape positions to explore interactions between management and topographical position. Over the course of two growing seasons, differences in microbial biomass, extracellular enzyme production and carbon and nitrogen mineralization were quantified at different topographical positions (summits, slopes, and depressions) in each of the three agricultural management systems. Alone, management practices had little to no impact on soil microbial traits, however, significant management by landscape position and management by time interactions were observed for extracellular enzymes. Acid phosphatase activity on hill slopes was 35-52\% greater in low input systems than in conventional and organic management systems. Similarly, spring amino peptidase activity was roughly 100\% higher in low input than in organic systems. Landscape position also had substantial effects on both microbial biomass and enzyme activities. Topographical depressions exhibited significantly higher activities of β. N-acetylglucosaminadase, β-glucosidase, phenol oxidase and greater microbial biomass than summits and slopes (26\%, 30\%, 36\%, and 55\%, respectively). Similarly, peroxidase activity was approximately 38\% greater in depressions and on summits than on hill slopes. Differences in microbial traits among positions were also negatively correlated with soil bulk density and sand content and positively correlated with clay, silt, carbon, nitrogen and moisture content. Our study stresses the importance of accounting for topographical heterogeneity when assessing the impact of management practices on belowground ecological function. Further, while management practices alone had little effect on soil microbial biomass and function, our study demonstrates that low input management programs may be beneficial for retaining microbial resources and thus promoting microbial activity on erosion-prone hill slopes.},

Emerging insights into factors responsible for soil organic matter stabilization and decomposition are being applied in a variety of contexts, but new tools are needed to facilitate the understanding, evaluation, and improvement of soil biogeochemical theory and models at regional to global scales. To isolate the effects of model structural uncertainty on the global distribution of soil carbon stocks and turnover times we developed a soil biogeochemical testbed that forces three different soil models with consistent climate and plant productivity inputs. The models tested here include a first-order, microbial implicit approach (CASA-CNP), and two recently developed microbially explicit models that can be run at global scales (MIMICS and CORPSE). When forced with common environmental drivers, the soil models generated similar estimates of initial soil carbon stocks (roughly 1,400 Pg C globally, 0-100 cm), but each model shows a different functional relationship between mean annual temperature and inferred turnover times. Subsequently, the models made divergent projections about the fate of these soil carbon stocks over the 20 th century, with models either gaining or losing over 20 Pg C globally between 1901 and 2010. Single-forcing experiments with changed inputs, temperature, and moisture suggest that uncertainty associated with freeze-thaw processes as well as soil textural effects on soil carbon stabilization were larger than direct temperature uncertainties among models. Finally, the models generated distinct projections about the timing and magnitude of seasonal heterotrophic respiration rates, again reflecting structural uncertainties that were related to environmental sensitivities and assumptions about physicochemical stabilization of soil organic matter. By providing a computationally tractable and numerically consistent framework to evaluate models we aim to better understand uncertainties among models and generate insights about factors regulating the turnover of soil organic matter.},

However, there is a remarkable lack of information about the status quo of organic carbon in agricultural soils. In this study a comprehensive data set of 384 cropland soils and 333 grassland soils within the state of Bavaria in southeast Germany was analyzed in order to provide representative information on total amount, regional distribution and driving parameters of soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (N) in agricultural soils of central Europe. The results showed that grassland soils stored higher amounts of SOC (11.8kgm-2) and N (0.92kgm-2) than cropland soils (9.0 and 0.66kgm-2, respectively) due to moisture-induced accumulation of soil organic matter (SOM) in B horizons. Surprisingly, no distinct differences were found for the A horizons since tillage led to a relocation of SOM with depth in cropland soils. Statistical analyses of driving factors for SOM storage revealed soil moisture, represented by the topographic wetness index (TWI), as the most important parameter for both cropland and grassland soils. Climate effects (mean annual temperature and precipitation) were of minor importance in agricultural soils because management options counteracted them to a certain extent, particularly in cropland soils. The distribution of SOC and N stocks within Bavaria based on agricultural regions confirmed the importance of soil moisture since the highest cropland SOC and N stocks were found for tertiary hills and loess regions, which exhibited large areas with potentially high soil moisture content in extant floodplains. Grassland soils showed the highest accumulation of SOC and N in the Alps and Pre-Alps as a result of low temperatures, high amounts of precipitation and high soil moisture content in areas of glacial denudation. Soil class was identified as a further driving parameter for SOC and N storage in cropland soils. In total, cropland and grassland soils in Bavaria store 242 and 134Mt SOC as well as 19 and 12Mt N down to a soil depth of 1m or the parent material, respectively. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Sequestration of atmospheric carbon (C) in soils through improved management of forest and agricultural land is considered to have high potential for global CO2 mitigation. However, the potential of soils to sequester soil organic carbon (SOC) in a stable form, which is limited by the stabilization of SOC against microbial mineralization, is largely unknown. In this study, we estimated the C sequestration potential of soils in southeast Germany by calculating the potential SOC saturation of silt and clay particles according to Hassink [Plant and Soil 191 (1997) 77] on the basis of 516 soil profiles. The determination of the current SOC content of silt and clay fractions for major soil units and land uses allowed an estimation of the C saturation deficit corresponding to the long-term C sequestration potential. The results showed that cropland soils have a low level of C saturation of around 50\% and could store considerable amounts of additional SOC. A relatively high C sequestration potential was also determined for grassland soils. In contrast, forest soils had a low C sequestration potential as they were almost C saturated. A high proportion of sites with a high degree of apparent oversaturation revealed that in acidic, coarse-textured soils the relation to silt and clay is not suitable to estimate the stable C saturation. A strong correlation of the C saturation deficit with temperature and precipitation allowed a spatial estimation of the C sequestration potential for Bavaria. In total, about 395 Mt CO2 -equivalents could theoretically be stored in A horizons of cultivated soils - four times the annual emission of greenhouse gases in Bavaria. Although achieving the entire estimated C storage capacity is unrealistic, improved management of cultivated land could contribute significantly to CO2 mitigation. Moreover, increasing SOC stocks have additional benefits with respect to enhanced soil fertility and agricultural productivity.},

  abstract = {The management of soils as well as the impact of land use or climate changes are often evaluated in view of the storage of total soil organic carbon (SOC). However, as soil organic matter (SOM) is composed of different compounds with different degrees of stability and turnover times, there is the need for a soil- and land use-specific quantification of functional SOC pools. In this study, the amount of active, intermediate and passive SOC pools was determined for major soil types and land uses of Bavaria in southeast Germany. At 99 locations, soil horizons down to the parent material were fractionated according to the method of Zimmermann et al. (2007). The results showed that in cropland and grassland soils around 90\% of total SOC stocks can be assigned to the intermediate and passive SOC pool. High SOC stocks in grassland soils are partly related to a higher degree of soil aggregation compared to cropland soils. The contribution of intermediate SOC in cropland soils was similar to that in grassland soils due to an increased proportion of SOM associated with silt and clay particles. The cultivation-induced loss of SOC due to aggregate disruption is at least partly compensated by increased formation of organo-mineral associations as a result of tillage that continuously promotes the contact of crop residues with reactive mineral surfaces. Contrary, forest soils were characterized by distinctly lower proportions of intermediate and passive SOC and a high amount of active SOC in form of litter and particulate organic matter which accounted for almost 40\% of total SOC stocks. As both the amount of intermediate and passive SOC were lower in forest soils, we conclude that cropland and grassland soils may be more advantageous for long-term SOC storage in Bavaria. The high amount of labile SOC in forest topsoils poses the risk of considerable SOC losses caused by wildfire, mechanical disturbances or increasing temperatures. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The capacity of soils to store organic carbon represents a key function of soils that is not only decisive for climate regulation but also affects other soil functions. Recent efforts to assess the impact of land management on soil functionality proposed that an indicator- or proxy-based approach is a promising alternative to quantify soil functions compared to time- and cost-intensive measurements, particularly when larger regions are targeted. The objective of this review is to identify measurable biotic or abiotic properties that control soil organic carbon (SOC) storage at different spatial scales and could serve as indicators for an efficient quantification of SOC. These indicators should enable both an estimation of actual SOC storage as well as a prediction of the SOC storage potential, which is an important aspect in land use and management planning. There are many environmental conditions that affect SOC storage at different spatial scales. We provide a thorough overview of factors from micro-scales (particles to pedons) to the global scale and discuss their suitability as indicators for SOC storage: clay mineralogy, specific surface area, metal oxides, Ca and Mg cations, microorganisms, soil fauna, aggregation, texture, soil type, natural vegetation, land use and management, topography, parent material and climate. As a result, we propose a set of indicators that allow for time- and cost-efficient estimates of actual and potential SOC storage from the local to the regional and subcontinental scale. As a key element, the fine mineral fraction was identified to determine SOC stabilization in most soils. The quantification of SOC can be further refined by including climatic proxies, particularly elevation, as well as information on land use, soil management and vegetation characteristics. To enhance its indicative power towards land management effects, further “functional soil characteristics” particularly soil structural properties and changes in the soil microbial biomass pool should be included in this indicator system. The proposed system offers the potential to efficiently estimate the SOC storage capacity by means of simplified measures, such as soil fractionation procedures or infrared spectroscopic approaches.},

  abstract = {Soil and its biota are fundamental components of the "Critical Zone": Earth's living skin that most directly sustains life. Within that zone, geologically-rapid soil and saprolite displacement by biota, particularly invertebrate meso- and macrofauna, affects a large proportion of Earth's soils. This was first recognised by late-19th century observers, on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, who regarded bioturbation as fundamental to soil formation. Throughout much of the 20th century, however, the agronomical focus of soil scientists and the dominant paradigm of landscape evolution relegated bioturbation. As a result, many aspects of bioturbation are still not widely appreciated. Only in the last few decades has a re-evaluation commenced, in a range of disciplines. Primary effects of bioturbation, which we quantify herein, include soil production from saprolite, the formation of surface mounds, soil burial, and downslope transport. Rates of bioturbation can be as rapid as sustained maximum rates of tectonic uplift. In concert with surface geomorphic processes, bioturbation alters fundamental properties of soil, including particle-size distribution, porosity, the content of carbon and other nutrients, and creep flux rate. The precise influence of biotic mixing is regulated by its depth function. Earth's incredibly diverse soil biota also perform a number of functions, at a range of spatial and temporal scales, that extend beyond soil to landscape evolution, ecosystem engineering, niche construction, and carbon cycling. Understanding these linkages-which have operated since the evolution of trees in the Devonian Period-is of growing importance as we seek a fuller picture of Earth's history to predict and manage its future. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {To better understand the nature of the C flush that follows the rewetting of dry soil, we chemically characterized the water soluble pools following rewetting of soil dried to several different water potentials. To assess the impact that historical soil water status has on the size of the rewetting labile soluble pool, a laboratory water stress gradient was applied to soils that were collected from drought-prone and irrigated tallgrass prairie soils. In the laboratory, soils were either incubated at -33 kPa or dried steadily over a 0.6, 1, 2, or 3 day period to -1.5, -4, -15, and -45 MPa respectively. On the 4th day, samples were wetted back to -33 kPa and immediately assayed for soluble, microbial, or respiratory pools of carbon. After extraction, samples were also assayed using NMR, GC-MS, and LC-MS to assess carbohydrate, amino acid, osmolyte and sugar pools. The greater the degree of drying before rewetting was associated with greater concentrations of microbial, soluble and respiratory pools of carbon, increasing by 50, 400 and 250\%, respectively, in the most water stressed compared to continuously moist soil. Compared to drought-prone soils, the amount of soluble C released as a result of rewetting was 30 to 50\% greater in soils that were irrigated for 11 years. The pool of organics was not completely characterized and only small amounts of TBDMS and TMS derived compounds accounting for 2-4\% of the soluble C pool were detected. In contrast, oligosaccharides constituted approximately 20-25\% of the sample C. Our results suggest that the flush of C following wetting of a dry soil is not dominated by common microbial osmolytes (e.g. proline, glycine betaine, ectoine, glycerol, mannitol, trehalose). In light of this finding more research is needed to better understand the adaptations that microbial communities utilize to respond to the rewetting of dried soil. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Physical and chemical stabilization, environmental conditions, and organic matter composition all play vital roles in determining the persistence of soil organic matter (SOM). Fundamentally, SOM stability depends on the balance of microbial bioenergetics between the input of energy needed to decompose it (i.e., activation energy; Ea) and the net energy gained (i.e., energy density; ED) from its decomposition. This relationship is complicated in soils by chemical and physical protection mechanisms, which require additional energies to overcome for decomposition to occur. In this study, we analyze the bioenergetics of soil density fractions, which vary in their degrees of organic matter-mineral association, and show that the relationship of ED and Ea has the ability to provide information about relative differences in SOM chemical composition and stability. Our results demonstrate distinct bioenergetic signatures between particulate, light (free and occluded) fractions versus mineral-associated, heavy fractions isolated from soil samples collected at two depths from a climosequence along an elevation gradient in the Sierra Nevada, California. While there were no significant differences in ED and Ea within each fraction across climates, the light fractions (LF) were characterized by larger ED and Ea values, whereas the heavy fractions (HF) were characterized by smaller ED and Ea values. Combined with CHN analyses, we conclude that SOM in HF pools is likely comprised of relatively simple organic compounds that have long turnover rates because of chemical association with soil minerals, whereas the LF pools are comprised of more chemically complex molecules with low chemical reactivity and high Ea.},

The perspective chosen to illustrate this vast topic is that of the residual soil weathering profile. Different physical and chemical conditions characterize the various parts of such a profile. Thus, in the slightly weathered rock at the base of the profile, mineral weathering will take place in microfissures and narrow solution channels and the capillary water in such spatially restricted volumes may be expected to be close to equilibrium with the primary mineral. In these circumstances, the weathering product formed may be closely related to the primary mineral both compositionally and structurally. The saprolite higher up in the weathering profile may or may not retain the fabric and structure of the original parent rock, but in either case the close relationship observed between primary mineral and weathering product in the slightly weathered rock may be lost. This part of the profile will usually be affected by freely flowing drainage waters, the composition of which will be far from equilibrium with specific primary minerals. Weathering products which do form are likely to reflect the interaction between bulk water and bulk parent material. In the soil profile, the situation will be further complicated by organic ligands derived from decomposing organic matter or from the direct activities of soil microbes or plant roots. Thus, biological weathering will assume a much greater significance in this part of the profile compared with the mainly inorganic processes dominating in the saprolite and the slightly weathered rock. The general nature of any particular weathering profile will reflect the interactions between climate, topography, parent material, soil biota and time and superimposed upon this complexity, when considering how individual primary minerals break down in detail, will be factors related to the nature of the mineral itself. Particularly important in this respect is the inherent susceptibility of the mineral to weathering, which is related to overall chemical composition and structure, as well as the distribution and density of defects, dislocations and exsolution features, which often control the progress of the weathering reaction.},

Monitoring is therefore being promoted regionally, nationally, and internationally to assess and evaluate soil condition for the purposes of reporting and prioritisation of funding for natural resource management. Several technical and methodological obstacles remain that impede the broad-scale implementation of measurement and monitoring schemes, and we present a dataset designed to (i) assess the optimum size of sample site for soil monitoring, (ii) determine optimum sample numbers required across a site to estimate soil properties to known levels of precision and confidence, and (iii) assess differences in the selected soil properties between a range of land-use types across a basalt landscape of northern NSW. Sample site size was found to be arbitrary and a sample area 25 by 25m provided a suitable estimate of soil properties at each site. Calculated optimum sample numbers differed between soil property, depth, and land use. Soil pH had a relatively low variability across the sites studied, whereas carbon, nitrogen, and bulk density had large variability. Variability was particularly high for woodland soils and in the deeper soil layers. A sampling intensity of 10 samples across a sampling area 25 by 25m was found to yield adequate precision and confidence in the soil data generated. Clear and significant differences were detected between land-use types for the various soil properties determined but these effects were restricted to the near-surface soil layers (050 and 50100mm). Land use has a profound impact on soil properties near to the soil surface, and woodland soils at these depths had significantly higher carbon, nitrogen, and pH and lower bulk density than the other land uses. Soil properties between the other non-woodland land-use types were largely similar, apart from a modestly higher carbon content and higher soil acidity under improved pasture. Data for soil carbon assessment should account for equivalent mass, since this significantly modified carbon densities, particularly for the lighter woodland soils. Woodland soils had larger quantities of carbon (T/ha corrected for equivalent mass) than any other land-use type, and in order to maintain the largest quantity of carbon in this landscape, retaining trees and woodland is the most effective option. Results from this work are being used to inform further development the NSW Statewide Soil Monitoring Program. 2010 CSIRO.},

  abstract = {The fate of phosphorus (P) during pedogenesis has been historically conceptualized (Walker-Syers model) with time as the primary controlling state factor. Herein, we demonstrate that both climate and lithology exert a strong and interacting influence on the fate of P by examining coupled bioclimatic and parent material effects on soil P fractions. Three transects were investigated spanning a 2150-m elevation gradient (MAT = 17 → 3 °C/MAP = 330 → 1400 mm) across three separate bedrock lithologies (lithosequence: granite, andesite and basalt) within the Sierra Nevada and southern Cascades of California. The elevation gradient entails four bioclimatic zones (bioclimosequence: blue oak, ponderosa pine, white fir and red fir). Soil P fractions were determined by sequential fractionation and interpreted in the context of associated soil characterization data. The bioclimatic sequences demonstrate a weathering gradient with maximum intensity at mid-elevation sites, and corresponding changes in Fe/Al-(hydr)oxide content and aluminosilicate crystallinity. Phosphorus content of parent material varied by an order of magnitude (mean; mg P kg−1): andesite (1500) {$>$} basalt (1000) {$>$} granite (131). Differences in P content of parent material influenced Pt in soils. However, amounts and proportions of P in fractions were influenced by subtle to significant interactions between climate and lithology, owing to differences in chemical weathering and the abundance and crystallinity of Fe/Al-(hydr)oxides and aluminosilicates. This interactive effect of pedogenesis on clay mineralogy led to differences in P fractions dependent upon lithology and bioclimatic zone. Labile inorganic P (Pi) was uniformly higher in soils derived from granite, despite granite having significantly lower P content, a result of lower Fe/Al-(hydr)oxide generation in granitic soils. With descending elevation and increased weathering intensity, HCl-Pi (primary mineral bound P-apatite) declined in basalt and andesite but remained unchanged in granite owing to its greater resistance to chemical weathering. As weathering intensity increased, occluded P increased in basalt, decreased in andesite and was unchanged in granite, contradicting the paradigm of progressive P occlusion with increased weathering. This incongruity for andesite results from a dominance of poorly crystalline materials (e.g., ferrihydrite, allophane/imogolite) at less weathered sites versus more crystalline minerals at more weathered sites. This study highlights several caveats to the paradigm that time (i.e., degree of weathering) is universally the dominant pedogenic control of P fractionation. We identify the importance of interactions between lithology and climate in regulating the amount and types of weathering products that in turn control P fractionation and ecosystem P availability.},

We assess an alternative approach, termed "fall conservation deep tillage" (FCDT), to SOM stabilization through fall incorporation of crop residues into the soil profile together with N fertilizer. In an eastern Nebraska field under irrigated maize (Zea mays L.), we measured total soil C and N stocks on an equal soil mass basis (0- to 30-cm depth) and the composition of four SOM fractions after 14 yr of previous no-till management and 1, 2, and 3 yr after conversion to FCDT. After 3 yr of FCDT, redistribution of soil C, N, and soil organic matter fractions occurred within the soil profile; however, total soil C and N stocks remained unchanged. An increase in the soil—crop residue contact surface through FCDT increased free light fraction by 170\% in deeper strata in the soil profile. Change from no-till to FCDT led to initial reduction of C and N stocks as mobile and calcium bound humic acid fractions after 1 yr of tillage, suggesting enhanced decomposition and/or condensation. By the second and third years of FCDT, stabilization of crop residues into these humified fractions was significant. The trends observed after 3 yr of FCDT at field-scale match prior plot-scale experiments from the same region and suggest that a positive balance of soil C and N accrual and loss may be achieved by enhancing the soil-residue contact surface in these soils.},

  abstract = {Given appropriate management, soils may serve as a sink for carbon, and thereby play a potentially important role in helping countries meet CO2 emission reductions as agreed to under the Kyoto Protocol. To fully judge the capacity of soils to store carbon, however, gaps regarding the mechanisms of organic carbon (OC) stabilization need to be filled. A number of studies have demonstrated the significance of oxides in the preservation of soil OC. Although oxides are known to strongly bind with clay minerals, potential interactions between these minerals in OC preservation in soils are often overlooked. The goal of this study was to, thus, examine possible interactions between clay minerals and oxides in the storage of soil OC. For this, we analysed how the OC, clay content, clay mineralogy and dithionite-extractable Fe (Fed) and oxalate-extractable Fe (Feo) and Al (Alo) concentrations of several sampled soils are statistically related. Samples from two Umbrisols, a Stagnic Acrisol, an Anthrosol/Vertisol/Gleysol-Chernozem and a Gleysol (FAO terminology) from profiles located in Hesse, Germany were analysed. Clay content exhibited a strong significant relationship with the OC concentrations of only two soils. Feo and Alo were found to be strongly related to the OC concentrations of most profiles. Some clay minerals such as chlorite displayed very strong relationships with OC and Feo and Alo concentrations. The results suggest that oxides interact with clay minerals in at least two of the soils examined, forming complexes or aggregates which may play an important role in stabilizing organic material. Future studies should also consider potential mineral interactions in the sequestration of OC in soils. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Tropical forests play a major role in regulating global carbon (C) fluxes and stocks, and even small changes to C cycling in this productive biome could dramatically affect atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO(2) ) concentrations. Temperature is expected to increase over all land surfaces in the future, yet we have a surprisingly poor understanding of how tropical forests will respond to this significant climatic change. Here we present a contemporary synthesis of the existing data and what they suggest about how tropical forests will respond to increasing temperatures. Our goals were to: (i) determine whether there is enough evidence to support the conclusion that increased temperature will affect tropical forest C balance; (ii) if there is sufficient evidence, determine what direction this effect will take; and, (iii) establish what steps should to be taken to resolve the uncertainties surrounding tropical forest responses to increasing temperatures. We approach these questions from a mass-balance perspective and therefore focus primarily on the effects of temperature on inputs and outputs of C, spanning microbial- to ecosystem-scale responses. We found that, while there is the strong potential for temperature to affect processes related to C cycling and storage in tropical forests, a notable lack of data combined with the physical, biological and chemical diversity of the forests themselves make it difficult to resolve this issue with certainty. We suggest a variety of experimental approaches that could help elucidate how tropical forests will respond to warming, including large-scale in situ manipulation experiments, longer term field experiments, the incorporation of a range of scales in the investigation of warming effects (both spatial and temporal), as well as the inclusion of a diversity of tropical forest sites. Finally, we highlight areas of tropical forest research where notably few data are available, including temperature effects on: nutrient cycling, heterotrophic versus autotrophic respiration, thermal acclimation versus substrate limitation of plant and microbial communities, below-ground C allocation, species composition (plant and microbial), and the hydraulic architecture of roots. Whether or not tropical forests will become a source or a sink of C in a warmer world remains highly uncertain. Given the importance of these ecosystems to the global C budget, resolving this uncertainty is a primary research priority.},

Here we show that by including microbial interactions in a SOC model, persistence can be explained as a feedback between substrate availability, mineral protection and microbial population size, without invoking an unproven pool that is intrinsically stable for centuries. The microbial SOC model based on this concept reproduces long-term data (r2 = 0.92; n = 90), global SOC distribution (rmse = 4.7 +/− 0.6 kg C m−2), and total global SOC in the top 0.3 m (822 Pg C) accurately. SOC dynamics based on a microbial feedback without stable pools are thus consistent with global SOC distribution. This has important implications for carbon management, suggesting that relatively fast cycling, rather than recalcitrant, SOC must form the primary target of efforts to build SOC stocks.},

In this study, soil profile data compiled by China's second national soil survey conducted in the 1980s was used to investigate the spatial distribution of SIC for the entire country under present day conditions as well as changes in SIC under historical land use. Results showed that the total SIC storage in China was approximately 55.3 ?? 10.7 Pg C with a current average content of 6.3 ?? 1.2 kg C m-2, representing 5.8\% of the global SIC pool. Land use has significantly affected SIC levels in cultivated soils. Approximately 51\% of total cultivated soil surfaces in China have experienced C loss where the most significant loss has been observed in the eastern part of northern China in dry farmlands as well as irrigated soils and paddy soils. On the contrary, SIC has increased (???10\%) in irrigated soils in northwestern China. No significant change (???39\%) has been observed in soils in southern and the eastern part of northeast China. The total loss of SIC in China was approximately 1.6 Pg C due to extensive human activity.

Seven years after the applications ended, the effects of biosolids and manure on SOC were greater than alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), wood, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) residue, sucrose, brassica residue, cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), wheat compost, or the unamended check. Soil C increases ranged from 3 to 49\% of C applied and had changed little in the previous 28 mo. Plots sown to con-tinuous winter wheat during the period of amendment had 10\% more SOC than plots that had been fallow, an effect more than twice as large as most amendments. This suggests that the contribution of roots to SOC was more important than aboveground crop residues. The effect of amendments on SOC was highly correlated to their initial P content. In addition, for a similar available soil P and soil S content, SOC was significantly greater where wheat or perennial grass was grown. Wood caused an increase in the C/N ratio that persisted {$>$}3.5 yr but almost disappeared by the seventh year. This study indi-cated that continuous cropping or the addition of animal waste or municipal biosolids had the greatest impact on the formation of SOC, and this positive effect remained stable for many years after the end of the continuous treat-ment applications.

Here, we document the response of fine roots to long-term nitrogen (N), P and potassium (K) fertilization in a lowland forest in Panama.

In this study, we propose three mathematical strategies at different levels of abstraction to represent those interactions. By implementing these strategies into the Introductory Carbon Balance Model (ICBM) and applying them to several scenarios of litter input, we show that the different levels of abstraction are applicable at different timescales. We present a simple one-parameter equation of substrate limitation that can straightforwardly be implemented into other models of SOM dynamics at decadal timescale. The study demonstrates how substrate quality interactions can explain patterns of priming effects, accelerate turnover in FACE experiments, and the slowdown of decomposition in long-term bare fallow experiments as an effect of energy limitation of microbial biomass. The mechanisms of those interactions need to be further scrutinized empirically for a more complete understanding. Overall, substrate quality interactions contribute to both understanding and quantitatively modelling SOM dynamics.},

  abstract = {A depth- and particle size-specific analysis of soil organic carbon (SOC) and its isotopic composition was undertaken to investigate the effects of soil texture (or particle size) on the depth profile of stable carbon isotopic composition of SOC (δ13 CSOC) in two tropical soils. Depth-specific samples from two soil profiles of markedly different texture (coarse grained and fine grained) were separated into particle size classes and analyzed for the (mass/mass) concentration of SOC (C) and δ13 CSOC. Within 1 m of the soil surface, δ13 CSOC in the coarse-textured soil increases by 1.3 to 1.6‰, while δ13CSOC from the fine-textured soil increase by as much as 3.8 to 5.5‰. This increasing depth trend in the coarse-textured soil is approximately linear with respect to normalized C, while the increase in the fine-textured soil follows a logarithmic function with respect to normalized C. A model of Rayleigh distillation describing isotope fractionation during decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) accounts for the depth profile of δ13CSOC in the fine-textured soil, but does not account for the depth profile observed in the coarse-textured soil despite their similar climate, vegetation, and topographic position. These results suggest that kinetic fractionation during humification of SOM leads to preferential accumulation of 13C in association with fine mineral particles, or aggregates of fine mineral particles in fine-textured soils. In contrast, the coarse-textured soil shows very little applicability of the Rayleigh distillation model. Rather, the depth profile of δ13CSOC in the coarse-textured soil can be accounted for by mixing of soil carbon with different isotopic ratios. Copyright © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.},

We measured depth trends of 13C abundance from cropland and control pairs of soils in the lower Mississippi Basin, as well as the 13C abundance of soil-respired CO2 produced during approximately 1-year soil incubation, to determine the role of several candidate processes on the 13C depth profile of soil organic matter. Depth profiles of 13C from uncultivated control soils show a strong relationship between the natural logarithm of soil organic carbon concentration and its isotopic composition, consistent with a model Rayleigh distillation of 13C in decomposing soil due to kinetic fractionation during decomposition. Laboratory incubations showed that initially respired CO 2 had a relatively constant 13C content, despite large differences in the 13C content of bulk soil organic matter. Initially respired CO2 was consistently 13C-depleted with respect to bulk soil and became increasingly 13C-depleted during 1-year, consistent with the hypothesis of accumulation of 13C in the products of microbial decomposition, but showing increasing decomposition of 13C-depleted stable organic components during decomposition without input of fresh biomass. We use the difference between 13C / 12C ratios (calculated as δ-values) between respired CO 2 and bulk soil organic carbon as an index of the degree of decomposition of soil, showing trends which are consistent with trends of 14C activity, and with results of a two-pooled kinetic decomposition rate model describing CO2 production data recorded during 1 year of incubation. We also observed inconsistencies with the Rayleigh distillation model in paired cropland soils and reasons for these inconsistencies are discussed. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Clean rain was applied to the soil surface by reducing the nitrogen, sulphur and proton inputs to 67\%, 56\% and 74\% of the loads in ambient throughfall. The drought/rewetting experiment was carried out by artificially modifying weather extremes of drought and rewetting events. Hydrochemical input-output budgets, based on element fluxes in throughfall and in soil seepage water, have been established for major elements. Results show that on this highly acidified soft, atmospheric deposition widely influenced element fluxes in the soil seepage water. Consequently, hydrochemical budgets altered when inputs of acidity and nitrogen were reduced. After one year of the clean rain treatment nitrate output was considerably reduced. The nitrate and proton budgets changed from surplus to deficit. The sulphur deficit was further increased by reducing sulphur input. In the course of the drought/rewetting experiment, a distinct increase of nitrate budgets was found. A possible nitrification or an acidification pulse was not observed.},

The method was usually thought to have low precision and a high background. We have modified the zinc reduction method originally outlined in Vogel [J.S. Vogel, Radiocarbon 34 (3) (1992) 344] by carefully controlling the amounts of reagents (zinc, titanium hydride and Co or Fe catalyst) and now routinely obtain a precision of 2-3‰ and a relatively low background of ∼50,000 14C years when analyzing for 14C at the Keck Carbon Cycle AMS facility at UC Irvine. Fractionation of carbon isotopes does occur during graphitization and depends on the graphitization yield, which can be affected by the amounts of reagents used and other conditions. The δ13C of our zinc-reduced graphite is usually lighter by 2-3‰ than the CO2 from which it is made, but this is corrected for in our system by simultaneous measurement of 13C/12C along with 14C/12C by the spectrometer. This method is suitable for 14C enriched samples, as well as natural abundance 14C samples, especially those with modern 14C contents. With improved precision and background, we believe that many disciplines can benefit from this technique because of its low cost and rapid production of graphite.},

We compiled a global database of C, N, P, and S concentrations in soils and microbes and developed relationships between them by using a power function model. The C:N:P:S was estimated to be 287:17:1:0.8 for soils, and 42:6:1:0.4 for microbes. We found a convergence of the relationships between elements in soils and in soil microbial biomass across C, N, P, and S. The element concentrations in soil microbial biomass follow a homeostatic regulation curve with soil element concentrations across C, N, P and S, implying a unifying mechanism of microbial assimilating soil elements. This correlation explains the wellconstrained C: N: P: S stoichiometry with a slightly larger variation in soils than in microbial biomass. Meanwhile, it is estimated that the minimum requirements of soil elements for soil microbes are 0.8 mmol C Kg(-1) dry soil, 0.1 mmol N Kg(-1) dry soil, 0.1 mmol P Kg(-1) dry soil, and 0.1 mmol S Kg(-1) dry soil, respectively.

  abstract = {Soil microbes play important roles in regulating terrestrial carbon and nitrogen cycling and strongly influence feedbacks of ecosystems to global warming. However, the inconsistent responses of microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) to experimental warming have been observed, and the response ratio between MBC and MBN (MBC:MBN) has not been identified. This meta-analysis synthesized warming experiments at 58 sites globally to investigate the responses of MBC:MBN to climate warming. Our results showed that warming significantly increased MBC by 3.61 ± 0.80\% and MBN by 5.85 ± 0.90\% and thus decreased the MBC:MBN by 3.34 ± 0.66\%. MBC showed positive responses to warming but MBN exhibited negative responses to warming at low warming magnitude ({$<$}1 °C); however, at high warming magnitude ({$>$}2 °C) the results were inverted. The different effects of warming magnitude on microbial biomass resulted from the warming-induced decline in soil moisture and substrate supply. Moreover, MBC and MBN had strong positive responses to warming at the mid-term (3–4 years) or short-term (1–2 years) duration, but the responses tended to decrease at long-term (≥5 years) warming duration. This study fills the knowledge gap on the responses of MBC:MBN to warming and may benefit the development of coupled carbon and nitrogen models.},

Here, we demonstrate that for millennia, human populations have resided in the same narrow part of the climatic envelope available on the globe, characterized by a major mode around \$\textbackslash sim\$11 °C to 15 °C mean annual temperature (MAT). Supporting the fundamental nature of this temperature niche, current production of crops and livestock is largely limited to the same conditions, and the same optimum has been found for agricultural and nonagricultural economic output of countries through analyses of year-to-year variation. We show that in a business-as-usual climate change scenario, the geographical position of this temperature niche is projected to shift more over the coming 50 y than it has moved since 6000 BP. Populations will not simply track the shifting climate, as adaptation in situ may address some of the challenges, and many other factors affect decisions to migrate. Nevertheless, in the absence of migration, one third of the global population is projected to experience a MAT {$>$}29 °C currently found in only 0.8\% of the Earth's land surface, mostly concentrated in the Sahara. As the potentially most affected regions are among the poorest in the world, where adaptive capacity is low, enhancing human development in those areas should be a priority alongside climate mitigation.},

This paper reports a pore-scale modeling study to investigate the response of heterotrophic respiration to moisture conditions in soils and to evaluate various factors that affect this response. X-ray computed tomography was used to derive soil pore structures, which were then used for pore-scale model investigation. The pore-scale results were then averaged to calculate the effective respiration rates as a function of water content in soils. The calculated effective respiration rate first increases and then decreases with increasing soil water content, showing a maximum respiration rate at water saturation degree of 0.75, which is consistent with field and laboratory observations. The relationship between the respiration rate and moisture content is affected by various factors, including pore-scale organic carbon bioavailability, the rate of oxygen delivery, soil pore structure and physical heterogeneity, soil clay content, and microbial drought resistivity. Overall, this study provides mechanistic insights into the soil respiration response to the change in moisture conditions, and reveals a complex relationship between heterotrophic microbial respiration rate and moisture content in soils that is affected by various hydrological, geophysical, and biochemical factors.},

Covington (1981) described a pattern in organic matter storage in the forest floors of northern hardwood stands as a function of date of harvest. We review the history of the use and misuse of Covington's curve, describe the studies that tested and failed to support early interpretations of the curve, and provide some alternate interpretations. The curve suggested that forest floor organic matter declines by 50\% within 20 years after harvest, and this decline was attributed to accelerated decomposition and changes in litter inputs after harvest. Subsequent studies showed that decomposition rates of surface litter generally decrease after clear-cutting, but accelerated decomposition remains possible in the Oe and Oa horizons. Changes in litter inputs are still difficult to evaluate, because the rate at which woody debris enters the forest floor is unknown. Although Covington attempted to minimize variation due to mechanical disturbance during logging, a reasonable alternative explanation for low organic matter in the forest floor of young stands is that surface material is mixed into mineral soil during harvesting operations. The pattern of forest floor organic matter in stands of different ages may be partly due to changes over time in logging technology and the intensity of biomass removal, in addition to successional effects. It is important to distinguish between mechanisms that release carbon to the atmosphere and those that transfer it to the mineral soil before making inferences about nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration.},

  abstract = {The question of how tropical trees cope with infertile soils has been challenging to address, in part, because fine root dynamics must be studied in situ. We used annual fertilization with nitrogen (N as urea, 12.5gNm-2year-1), phosphorus (P as superphosphate, 5gPm-2year-1) and potassium (K as KCl, 5gKm-2year-1) within 38ha of old-growth lowland tropical moist forest in Panama and examined fine root dynamics with minirhizotron images. We expected that added P, above all, would (i) decrease fine root biomass but, (ii) have no impact on fine root turnover. Soil in the study area was moderately acidic (pH=5.28), had moderate concentrations of exchangeable base cations (13.4cmolkg-1), low concentrations of Bray-extractable phosphate (PO4=2.2mgkg-1), and modest concentrations of KCl-extractable nitrate (NO3=5.0mgkg-1) and KCl-extractable ammonium (NH4=15.5mgkg-1). Added N increased concentrations of KCl-extractable NO3 and acidified the soil by one pH unit. Added P increased concentrations of Bray-extractable PO4 and P in the labile fraction. Concentrations of exchangeable K were elevated in K addition plots but reduced by N additions. Fine root dynamics responded to added K rather than added P. After 2 years, added K decreased fine root biomass from 330 to 275gm-2. The turnover coefficient of fine roots {$<$}1mm diameter ranged from 2.6 to 4.4 per year, and the largest values occurred in plots with added K. This study supported the view that biomass and dynamics of fine roots respond to soil nutrient availability in species-rich, lowland tropical moist forest. However, K rather than P elicited root responses. Fine roots smaller than 1mm have a short lifetime ({$<$}140 days), and control of fine root production by nutrient availability in tropical forests deserves more study. © 2010 The Authors.

The sorption experiments were complemented by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy to gain possible mechanistic insight into the organic acids-mineral interactions. In terms of charge, the organic solutes ranged from strongly negative (i.e., citric) to positively charged solutes (i.e., lysine); similarly the mineral phases also ranged from positively to negatively charged surfaces. In general, sorption of anionic carboxylic and glutamic acids was higher compared to the other compounds (except lysine). Cationic lysine showed a stronger affinity to permanently charged phyllosilicates than Fe oxides. The sorption of alanine and phenylalanine was consistently low for all minerals, with relatively higher sorption and lower desorption of phenylalanine than alanine. Overall, the role of carboxylic functional groups for the sorption and retention of these carboxylic and amino acids on Fe oxides (and kaolinite) and of amino group on 2:1 phyllosilicates was noticeable. Mineral properties (surface chemistry, specific surface area), chemistry of the organic compounds (pK a value, functional groups) and the equilibrium pH of the system together controlled the differences in sorption-desorption patterns.

Sequential density fractionation was done to isolate particulate organic matter (POM, {$<$}1.8 g cm−3) and mineral associated OM (MOM: 1.8–2.2, 2.2–2.6 and {$>$}2.6 g cm−3) from four soils, i.e., a Ferralsol, a Luvisol, a Vertisol and a Solonetz. Organic matter (OM) in the density fractions was characterised using diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy in the original states (i.e., without any chemical pre-treatment), and after 6\% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and 10\% hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatments. The NaOCl oxidation resistant fraction was considered as a relatively stable pool of OC and the HF soluble fraction was presumed as the mineral bound OC. Phyllosilicate-dominated soils, i.e., Vertisol, Luvisol and Solonetz, contained a greater proportion of POM than Fe and Al oxide-dominated Ferralsol. Wider C:N ratio and lower δ13C and δ15N in POM suggest the dominance of labile OC in this fraction and this was also supported by a greater proportion of NaOCl oxidised OC in the same fraction that was enriched with aliphatic C. The sequential density fractionation method effectively isolated OM into three distinct groups in the soils: (i) OM associated with Fe and Al oxides ({$>$}1.8 g cm−3in the Ferralsol); (ii) OM associated with phyllosilicates (1.8–2.6 g cm−3) and (iii) OM associated with quartz and feldspar ({$>$}2.6 g cm−3) in the other three soils. Greater oxidation resistance, and more dissolution of OC during the HF treatment in the Fe and Al oxides dominated fractions suggest a greater potential of these minerals to protect OC from oxidative degradation as compared to the phyllosilicates, and quartz and feldspar matrices. OM associated with Fe and Al oxides was predominantly aromatic and carboxylate C. Decreased C:N ratio in the NaOCl oxidation resistant OM and HF soluble OM of phyllosilicates, and quartz and feldspars dominant fractions compared to their untreated fractions indicate a preferred retention of N rich organic compounds by these minerals. OM associated with phyllosilicates was enriched with protonated amide N and aromatic C. Quartz and feldspars associated OM comprised of N containing organic compounds and polysaccharides, although we don't expect any role of these minerals in their preservation. Our results imply that the abundance and surface properties of minerals in the soil largely control the dynamics of OC and subsequently protect OC from microbial cycling.},

Two microcosm studies demonstrated that the presence of roots significantly increased mineral availability and promoted the formation of SRO phases. Mineral transformation experiments and isotopic labeling experiments provided direct evidence that citric acid, a major component of root exudates, promoted the formation of SRO minerals, and that SRO minerals acted as “nuclei” for C retention. Together, these findings indicate that soil organic amendments initialize a positive feedback loop by increasing mineral availability and promoting the formation of SRO minerals for further C binding, thereby possibly serving as a management tool for enhancing carbon storage in soils.},

  abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) has often been separated into operational physical fractions, such as particulate organic matter (POM) and mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM), to improve our understanding of SOM persistence. While it is generally assumed that POM and MAOM have distinct biogeochemical characteristics, it remains unresolved where and why POM and MAOM differ in their composition and relationships to total SOM decomposition among heterogenous soils. We analyzed elemental, isotopic, and chemical composition, including diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra, of POM and MAOM in 156 soil samples collected from 20 National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) sites spanning diverse ecosystems (tundra to tropics) across North America. We used a classic size separation method for POM (53–2000 μm) and MAOM ({$<$}53 μm) following chemical dispersion. Values of C/N, δ13C, and DRIFT spectra for C–H (aliphatic)/C[dbnd]O were correlated and often similar in POM and MAOM fractions across diverse soils; DRIFT spectra for C[dbnd]C (aromatic)/C[dbnd]O were often similar but uncorrelated between fractions. A prevalent hypothesis holds that MAOM is dominated by microbial-derived OM, yet our findings suggest that plant-derived OM can also contribute substantially to MAOM, especially in wet forests receiving {$>$}1200 mm annual precipitation (with MAOM C/N {$>$} 15). Multiple statistical analyses showed that C quantity and chemical composition of MAOM could as effectively predict soil C decomposition during an 18-month incubation as measures of POM. Thus, POM and MAOM both likely contributed significantly to decomposition over timescales of months, possibly because characteristics of POM and MAOM were often related and/or a large pool size of MAOM could compensate for its lower decomposition rate relative to POM. Further, we found that soil geochemical composition (such as silt and clay, calcium, oxalate-extractable iron and aluminum), along with climate and ecosystem type, could partly predict differences in quantity and composition between POM and MAOM. Overall, relative coupling vs. decoupling between POM and MAOM among soils was predictable based on geochemistry, and these similarities/differences provide insight into variation in the plant-derived sources of MAOM across diverse ecosystems. The importance of MAOM to short-term soil C decomposition has probably been underappreciated.},

Stoichiometry allows for spanning different levels of biological organization, from cellular metabolism to ecosystem structure and nutrient cycling, and is therefore particularly useful for establishing links between different ecosystem compartments. We review elemental carbon?:?nitrogen?:?phosphorus (C:N:P) ratios in terrestrial ecosystems (from vegetation, leaf litter, woody debris, and dead roots, to soil microbes and organic matter). While the stoichiometry of the plant, litter, and soil compartments of ecosystems is well understood, heterotrophic microbial communities, which dominate the soil food web and drive nutrient cycling, have received increasing interest in recent years. This review highlights the effects of resource stoichiometry on soil microorganisms and decomposition, specifically on the structure and function of heterotrophic microbial communities and suggests several general patterns. First, latitudinal gradients of soil and litter stoichiometry are reflected in microbial community structure and function. Second, resource stoichiometry may cause changes in microbial interactions and community dynamics that lead to feedbacks in nutrient availability. Third, global change alters the C:N, C:P, and N:P ratios of primary producers, with repercussions for microbial decomposer communities and critical ecosystem services such as soil fertility. We argue that ecological stoichiometry provides a framework to analyze and predict such global change effects at various scales.},

Spatially-distributed soil erosion data are needed for validating physically-based erosion prediction models and for better understand- ing soil erosion dynamics. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the feasibility of using rare earth element (REE) oxides directly as tracers for soil erosion studies by examining their binding ability with soil materials, and also to test a quick acid-extraction procedure. Five REE oxide powders were directly mixed with a Miami silt loam soil (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalfs) and then leached with deionized water in a soil box to evaluate the mobility of REEs. Follow- ing leaching, soil samples were sectioned in 25-mm increments and analyzed for REEs. The REE-tagged soil was wet sieved to obtain REE concentrations in each aggregate size group. A simple acid- leaching method was used to extract REEs from all soil samples. The extracts were analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spec- trometry (ICP-MS) techniques. The data indicated that the maximum coefficient of variation of the proposed procedure was ?10\% for all REEs. The REE oxides were uniformly incorporated into soil aggregates of different sizes (?53 ?m) and were bound with silt-size particles. This finding shows that the direct use of REE oxides is feasible, which should be superior to other REE-tagged particulate tracers because it eliminates the need of tagging exotic particles with REEs.Also, direct mixing of a traceamountofREEsdoes not substan- tially alter physicochemical properties of soil particles and aggregates. This work has shown that REE oxides have a great potential for tracing soil erosion and aggregation. X.C.},

This practice improves soil carbon sequestration, due to the high level of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in organic manure. In this study, batch equilibrium studies were conducted to examine the capacity of three ultisols from areas under different land use patterns to retain dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) extracted from rape cake and chicken manure. The results showed that the amount of DOM removed or released in solution by the soil was a linear function of the initial amount added to the soil-water system; therefore, analysis of sorption isotherms was best conducted using the initial mass isotherm IM method. The ultisol retained, on average, 19.9\% of the total DOC and 41.7\% of the total DON in solution, suggesting that ultisol has a relatively low DOC adsorption capacity. The ultisol from a bamboo forest was found to have a higher capacity than that from a pear orchard to retain DOC and DON. The adsorption affinities of DOM according to soil type were in the following order: bamboo forest (BF). {$>$}. tea garden (TG). {$>$}. pear orchard (PO). These results suggested that the continuous application of high doses of organic manure, particularly rape cake, may saturate the DOC adsorptive sites, thereby permitting increased leaching of DOC and the possibility of ground water contamination. Furthermore, we note that amorphous Fe and Al oxides play an important role in the adsorption capacity of both DOC and DON in ultisols. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The spatial patterns of SOC stocks stratified by soil types, watershed (buffer analysis), topographical factors, and land use types were identified. Results showed that the soils in Zhejiang covered an area of 100 740 km2 with a total SOC stock of 831.49 × 106 t and a mean SOC density of 8.25 kg m−2, excluding water and urban areas. In terms of soil types, red soils had the highest SOC stock (259.10 × 106 t), whereas mountain meadow soils contained the lowest (0.15 × 106 t). In terms of SOC densities, the lowest value (5.11 kg m−2) was found in skel soils, whereas the highest value (45.30 kg m−2) was observed in mountain meadow soils. Yellow soils, as a dominant soil group, determined the SOC densities of different buffer zones in Qiantang River watershed because of their large area percentage and wide variation of SOC density values. The area percentages of various soil groups significantly varied with increasing elevation or slope when overlaid with digital elevation model data, thus influencing the SOC densities. The highest SOC density was observed under grassland, whereas the lowest SOC density was identified under unutilized land. The map of SOC density (0–100 cm depth) and the spatial patterns of SOC stocks in the Province would be helpful for relevant agencies and communities in Zhejiang Province, China.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to predict soil properties and quantify uncertainty in the derived soil property maps over large areas using sparse and ad-hoc samples. According to the soil-landscape model, each soil sample contains corresponding relationships between soil and environment conditions. Under the assumption that the more similar the environment conditions between two locations the more similar the soil property values, each sample can be considered as a representative (individual representativeness) over areas of similar environmental conditions. The level of representativeness of an individual sample to an unsampled location can be approximated by the similarity in environmental conditions between the two locations. Based on this “individual representativeness” concept and with the use of Case-based Reasoning (CBR) idea, which solves new problems by referring to similar cases, soil property values at unsampled locations can be predicted based on their environmental similarity to the individual samples. Furthermore, the uncertainty associated with each prediction is related to the similarity and can thus be quantified. A case study located in Illy Region, Xinjiang, Northwest China, has demonstrated that the predicted map of soil organic matter of top layer is of good quality and the quantified uncertainty is positively correlated with prediction residual. This suggests that the approach can be an effective alternative for predicting soil property and reporting uncertainty in the resulting soil map over large areas with sparse and ad-hoc samples. Key},

  abstract = {Climate warming enhances multiple ecosystem C fluxes, but the net impact of changing C fluxes on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks over decadal to centennial time scales remains unclear. We investigated the effects of climate on C fluxes and soil C stocks using space-for-time substitution along a boreal forest climate gradient encompassing spatially replicated sites at each of three latitudes. All regions had similar SOC concentrations and stocks (5.6 to 6.7 kg C m-2). The three lowest latitude forests exhibited the highest productivity across the transect, with tree biomass:age ratios and litterfall rates 300\% and 125\% higher than those in the highest latitude forests, respectively. Likewise, higher soil respiration rates (\$\textbackslash sim\$55\%) and dissolved organic C fluxes (\$\textbackslash sim\$300\%) were observed in the lowest latitude forests compared to those in the highest latitude forests. The mid-latitude forests exhibited intermediate values for these indices and fluxes. The mean radiocarbon content (∆14C) of mineral-associated SOC (+9.6 ‰) was highest in the lowest latitude forests, indicating a more rapid turnover of soil C compared to the mid- and highest latitude soils (∆14C of -35 and -30 ‰, respectively). Indicators of the extent of soil organic matter decomposition, including C:N, δ13C, and amino acid and alkyl-C:O-alkyl-C indices, revealed highly decomposed material across all regions. These data indicate that the lowest latitude forests experience accelerated C fluxes that maintain relatively young but highly decomposed SOC. Collectively, these observations of within-biome soil C responses to climate demonstrate that the enhanced rates of SOC loss that typically occur with warming can be balanced by enhanced rates of C inputs.},

  abstract = {Understanding the response of soil organic carbon (SOC) to environmental and management factors is necessary for estimating the potential of soils to sequester atmospheric carbon. Changes over time in the amount and distribution of SOC fractions with different turnover rates can be estimated by means of soil SOC models such as RothC, which typically consider two to five SOC pools. Ideally, these pools should correspond to measurable SOC fractions. The aim of this study was to test the relationship between SOC pools used in RothC and fractions separated through a fractionation procedure. A total of 123 topsoil samples from agricultural sites (arable land, grassland and alpine pasture) across Switzerland were used. A combination of physical and chemical methods resulted in two sensitive (particulate organic matter and dissolved organic carbon), two slow (carbon associated to clay and silt or stabilized in aggregates) and one passive (oxidation-resistant carbon) SOM fractions. These fractions were compared with the estimated equilibrium model pools when the corresponding soils were modelled with RothC. Analysis revealed strong correlations between SOC in measured fractions and modelled pools. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients varied between 0.82 for decomposable plant materials (DPM), 0.76 for resistant plant mate- rials (RPM), 0.99 for humified organic matter (HUM) and biomass (BIO), and 0.73 for inert organic matter (IOM). The results show that the proposed fractionation procedure can be used with minor adaptations to identify measurable SOC fractions, which can be used to initialize and evaluate RothC for a wide range of site conditions.},

  abstract = {Quantifying gross primary production (GPP), the largest flux of the terrestrial carbon cycle, remains difficult at the landscape scale. Evergreen needleleaf (coniferous) forests in the western United States constitute an important carbon reservoir whose annual GPP varies from year-to-year due to drought, mortality, and other ecosystem disturbances. Evergreen forest productivity is challenging to determine via traditional remote sensing indices (i.e., NDVI and EVI), because detecting environmental stress conditions is difficult. We investigated the utility of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) to detect year-to-year variation in GPP in four coniferous forests varying in species composition in the western United States (Sierra Nevada, Cascade, and Rocky Mountains). We show that annually averaged, satellite-based observations of SIF (retrieved from GOME-2) were significantly correlated with annual GPP observed at eddy covariance towers over several years. Further, SIF responded quantitatively to drought-induced mortality, suggesting that SIF may be capable of detecting ecosystem disturbance in coniferous forests.},
