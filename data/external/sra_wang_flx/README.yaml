Contents:
  - Flux data for Fallbrook, Musick, and Chiquito sites from Wang et al. 2000
Notes:
  - Music site is analog for GRpp (~1300m)
  - Chiquito site is analog for GRrf (~2300m)
  - fluxes are reported for CO2 in the paper (Table 2) in units of mmol CO2 m-2 hr-1, but I converted them to Âµmol CO2 m-2 s-1 to enter the data in an accepted ISRaD format
  - I also have data given to me directly from the author, which I used to add the 14C data in this document
