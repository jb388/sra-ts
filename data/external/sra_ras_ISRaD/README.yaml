Contents:
  - C, N, fraction data for C. Rasmussen's archive soil data, collected in 2001 and 2009
Notes:
  - fractionation only performed for 2009 samples
  - from accompanying email:
    - "OK - data dump attached that includes C and N data for 2001 samples, C and N data for 2009 samples - all the bulk and all the fractions from each pit, radiocarbon for 2009 was only measured on bulk and fraction composites, plus physiochemical data for the "central pit" or pit 1 from the 2009 data. Hopefully it makes sense.

    Great to see data coming through all ready!
