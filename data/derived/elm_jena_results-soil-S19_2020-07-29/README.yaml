Contents:
  - carbon and nitrogen data for Sierra Nevada 2019 bulk soil samples
Notes:
  - .xls files are copied from the data/raw/elm_jena_results-soil-S19_2020-07-29
  - processing steps were as follows:
    1. convert "Probenname" to "ID"
    2. add sheet "CleanIDs_CN", which is a pivot table using using the converted IDs in which replicates are counted and C and N data are averaged as needed
    3. add sheet "elm_jena_results-soil-S19_x_2020-08-07.csv", which contains the same data as on the pivot table ("CleanIDs_CN"), and save it as a .csv file
