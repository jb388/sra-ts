  - CO2 release data for batch 2 of the 2019 Sierra Nevada soil incubations
Notes:
  - samples are composites of depth increments collected from 3 spatially replicated soil pits/profiles
  - reps were run as a separate batch due to miscommunication
  - incubations not performed until late summer 2020 due to COVID-19
  - modified sample names from original (suffix "_rep" was missing from all but the first measurment date)
  - added sheet 'S19b-flux' to compile time series of CO2 fluxes
  - samples analyzed:
