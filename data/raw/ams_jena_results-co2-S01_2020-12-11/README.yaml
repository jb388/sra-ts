  - AMS results (14C) for CO2 from 2001 composite soil incubations
Notes:
  - Due to limited sample quantity and subsequent low CO2 concentrations, samples in file "Beem-Miller_23.xlsx" were extracted online
  - The following samples did not have adequate CO2 to make the 14C measurement:
    - GRrf_comp_8-27_2001_a_5
    - GRwf_comp_13-28_2001_b_12
    - GRpp_comp_15-27_2001_b_18
  - All of the samples analyzed in file 'Beem-Miller_23.xlsx' were subsequently flushed and allowed to continue incubating to make a second measurement, including those that had enough of CO2 to measure 14C, so it should be possible to assess the impact of the additional incubation time on the values measured
  - radiocarbon values seem quite low for the GR samples, especially compared to the bulk data (both GRrf_8-27, and GRwf_13-28)
  - Additionally, sample ANrf_comp_11-32_2001_a_21_11 has an extremely low 14C value compared to the rep (likely some kind of issue there...)
